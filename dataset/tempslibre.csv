From under the dock,come the Canada geese,one by one
A day of sun,after many of rain,my dirty windows
In the room,white lillies in the vase,scent of pepper
Federal Express,reaches me through the fog,plumeria lei
Talking with you,now this morning somehow,scent of plumeria
Red as the poppy,maple leaves fall,on the memorial
Light-studded ferry,passes in the starless night,another week-end
A tunnel of fog,connects the two islands,warmth of my duvet
October morning,a new pair of new wool socks,on my very cold feet
First day of Autumn,even your touch feels,somewhat cooler
Last night of Summer,the bright full moon of last night,hidden by a cloud
All my lights off,to watch the rising,of the Harvest moon
