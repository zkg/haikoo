She waves,delicately With the movement,of the tree.

Of long nights lit with orange,"lanterns, Of wine cups and compliments and",kisses of the two-sword men.
And of dawn when weary sleepers Lie,"outstretched on the mats of the palace, And of the iris",stalk that is broken in the fountain.
Autumn winds roll through the,dry leaves On her garments; Autumn,birds shiver Athwart star-hung skies.
"Under the blossoming plum-tree, She expresses","the pilgrimage Of grey souls passing, Athwart love's scarlet",maples To the ash-strewn summit of death.

Gilded hummingbirds are whizzing,"Through the palace garden, Deceived by the jade",petals Of the Emperor's jewel-trees.
The wind half blows,"her robes, That subside Listlessly",As swaying pines.

She glances expectantly,"Through the pine avenue, To the cherry-tree summit",Where her lover will appear.

She is like the great,rains That fall over the,earth in winter-time.
Gaily he,offers Packets,of merchandise.
He is a harlequin of,"illusions, His nimble features Skip into smiles,","like rainbows, Cheating the villagers."
But in his heart all the while is,"another knowledge, The sorrow of the bleakness",of the long wet winter night.
One life is a long summer; Tall,hollyhocks stand proud upon its paths; Little yellow,"waves of sunlight, Bring scarlet butterflies."
"Another life is a brief autumn, Fierce",storm-rack scrawled with lightning Passed over it Leaving the naked,"bleeding earth, Stabbed with the swords of the rain."
He plots for,"he is angry, He sneers",for he is bold.
He clinches his fist Like a twisted,"snake; Coiling itself, preparing to raise its head, Above",the long grasses of the plain.
I have forgotten how many,"times he kissed me, But I cannot forget A swaying",branch--a leaf that fell To earth.
He stands irresolute,Cloaking the light of,his lantern.
Tonight he will either find,"new love or a sword-thrust, But his soul is",troubled with ghosts of old regret.
Like vines with crimson,flowers They climb Upwards,Into his heart.
"She was a dream of moons, of fluttering handkerchiefs,","Of flying leaves, of parasols, A riddle made to break my heart; The lightest",impulse To her was more dear than the deep-toned temple bell.
She fluttered to my sword-hilt an,"instant, And then flew away; But who will spend",all day chasing a butterfly?
Is it a vision,Under the,moonlight?
"No, it is only",A beautiful geisha,swaying down the street.
"Out of the rings and the bubbles, The curls and the","swirls of the water, Out of the crystalline shower of drops shattered","in play, Her body and her thoughts arose."

"Beware, for the",dying vine can hold The,strongest oak.
Only by,cutting at the root Can love,be altered.
Late in the night A,rosy glimmer yet defies,the darkness.
"But the evening is growing late, The blinds are",being lowered; She who held your heart and charmed you Is only,a rosy glimmer of flame remembered.
"Rain rattles on the pavement, Puddles",stand in the bluish stones; Afar in the,Yoshiwara Is she who holds my heart.
"Alas, the torn lantern",of my hope Trembles and sputters,in the rain.
I saw him pass at twilight;,He was a dark cloud travelling Over,palace roofs With one claw drooping.
One dainty,"thrust, no more Than","this, he needs."
His heart is like a wind Torn between cloud,and butterfly; Whether he will roll passively to,"one, Or chase endlessly the other."
My heart is broken and mournful,As rain heard beating Far off in the distance,While earth is parched more near.
He only can bow to men Lofty as a god,"To those beneath him, Who has taken sins and sorrows And whose deathless spirit",leaps Beneath them like a golden carp in the torrent.
But the laughing rains,of spring Will break the weak,green shoots of their love.
His will grow a towering,"stalk, Hers, a cowering flower",under it.
Would that the rains,of all the winters Might wash,away my grief!
"The cranes have come back to the temple,","The winds are flapping the flags about, Through a",flute of reeds I will blow a song.

The chrysanthemums spread,"their flattered heads, And scurry",off before the wind.
"Storm-birds of autumn With draggled wings: Sleet-beaten, wind-tattered, snow-frozen, Stopping",in sheer weariness Between the gnarled red pine trees Twisted in doubt and,"despair; Whence do you come, pilgrims, Over what snow fields?"

"Windy evening of autumn, By the","grey-green swirling river, People are resting like still boats Tugging",uneasily at their cramped chains.

I will scrawl,on the walls of,the night Faces.
"Leering, sneering, scowling, threatening faces;","Weeping, twisting, yelling, howling faces; Faces fixed in a contortion","between a scream and a laugh, Meaningless faces."
I will cover the walls of night With,"faces, Till you do not know If these faces","are but masks, or you the masks for them."
"Faces too grotesque for laughter, Faces","too shattered by pain for tears, Faces of such ugliness",That the ugliness grows beauty.
"They will haunt you morning,","evening, Burning, burning, ever",returning.

If one presses her warm lips to,this tablet The dust of my body will feel a,"thrill, deep down in the silent earth."
The sky spreads out its poor array Of tattered,"flags, Saffron and rose Over the weary huddle of housetops",Smoking their evening pipes in silence.
The city gleams with lights,this evening Like loud and yawning,laughter from red lips.
"As the fish that leaps from the river, As the dropping","of a November leaf at twilight, As the faint flicker of lightning down the","southern sky, So I saw beauty, far away."
I dreamed I caught your loveliness In little,"silver jars: And when you died I opened them, And",there was only soot within.

"Armies and emperors and kings, All","carrying different kinds of things, And marching in","so grand a way, You never saw the like by day."
So fine a show was never seen At,the great circus on the green; For every kind,beast and man Is marching in that caravan.
"At first they move a little slow, But still","the faster on they go, And still beside them close I",keep Until we reach the Town of Sleep.
Three of us afloat,in the meadow by,the swing.
Three of us,aboard in the basket,on the lea.
"Winds are in the air, they are blowing","in the spring, And waves are on the meadow",like the waves there are at sea.
"Where shall we adventure,","to-day that we're afloat, Wary of the weather",and steering by a star?
"Shall it be to Africa,","a-steering of the boat, To Providence, or","Babylon, or off to Malabar?"
but here's a squadron,a-rowing on the sea-- Cattle on the,meadow a-charging with a roar!
"Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as","mad as they can be, The wicket is the harbor",and the garden is the shore.
The coach is at the door at last;,"The eager children, mounting fast And kissing hands,","in chorus sing: Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!"
"To house and garden, field and lawn,","The meadow-gates we swung upon, To pump and stable, tree","and swing, Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!"
"And fare you well for evermore, O","ladder at the hayloft door, O hayloft where the cobwebs","cling, Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!"
"Crack goes the whip, and off we go; The","trees and houses smaller grow; Last, round the woody","turn we swing: Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!"
"When I was sick and lay a-bed, I had","two pillows at my head, And all my toys beside me",lay To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so,"I watched my leaden soldiers go, With different","uniforms and drills, Among the bed-clothes, through the hills."
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up,and down among the sheets; Or brought my trees and houses,"out, And planted cities all about."
I was the giant great and still That,"sits upon the pillow-hill, And sees before him, dale and",plain The pleasant Land of Counterpane.
Come up,"here, O",dusty feet!
The lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out Through the,blinds and the windows and bars; And high over head and all moving,"about, There were thousands of millions of stars."
We built a ship upon the stairs,"All made of the back-bedroom chairs, And filled it full of sofa pillows",To go a-sailing on the billows.
"We sailed along for days and days, And",had the very best of plays; But Tom fell out and hurt,"his knee, So there was no one left but me."
Bring the,comb and play upon,it!
"Marching,",here we,come!
Willie cocks,"his highland bonnet, Johnnie",beats the drum.
"Mary Jane commands the party,","Peter leads the rear; Feet in time, alert and","hearty, Each a Grenadier!"
All in the most martial manner,Marching double-quick; While the napkin like a,banner Waves upon the stick!
Here's enough of fame,"and pillage, Great",commander Jane!
Now that we've been,"round the village, Let's go",home again.
Dark brown is,"the river, Golden",is the sand.
It flows along,"for ever, With trees on either",hand.
"Green leaves a-floating, Castles","of the foam, Boats of mine a-boating--",Where will all come home?
On goes the river And out,"past the mill, Away down the valley,",Away down the hill.
"Away down the river, A","hundred miles or more, Other little",children Shall bring my boats ashore.
Through all the pleasant meadow-side,"The grass grew shoulder-high, Till the shining scythes went far and",wide And cut it down to dry.
These green and sweetly smelling crops,They led in wagons home; And they piled them here,in mountain-tops For mountaineers to roam.
"Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail, Mount Eagle","and Mount High;-- The mice that in these mountains dwell,",No happier are than I!
"O what a joy to clamber there,","O what a place for play, With the sweet, the dim, the","dusty air, The happy hills of hay!"
Whenever Auntie,moves around Her dresses make,a curious sound.
They trail behind,"her up the floor, And trundle",after through the door.
"The friendly cow all red and white,",I love with all my heart: She gives me cream with all,"her might, To eat with apple-tart."
"She wanders lowing here and there, And","yet she cannot stray, All in the pleasant open","air, The pleasant light of day."
And blown by all the winds that pass,"And wet with all the showers, She walks among the",meadow grass And eats the meadow flowers.
Up into the,cherry tree Who should climb,but little me?
I held the trunk,with both my hands And looked abroad,on foreign lands.
"I saw the next door garden lie, Adorned","with flowers, before my eye, And many pleasant places",more That I had never seen before.
I saw the dimpling river pass And,be the sky's blue looking-glass; The dusty roads go up,and down With people tramping into town.
If I could find a higher tree Farther,"and farther I should see, To where the grown-up river slips",Into the sea among the ships.
To where the roads on either hand Lead,"onward into fairy land, Where all the children dine","at five, And all the playthings come alive."
"Every night my prayers I say, And",get my dinner every day; And every,day that I've been good I get an orange after food.
"The child that is not clean and neat, With","lots of toys and things to eat, He is a naughty child, I'm",sure-- Or else his dear papa is poor.
My holes were hollow like a,"cup, In every hole the sea came","up, Till it could hold no more."
"All by myself I have to go, With",none to tell me what to do-- All alone beside,the streams And up the mountain-sides of dreams.
"The strangest things are there for me, Both","things to eat and things to see, And many frightening",sights abroad Till morning in the Land of Nod.
"Try as I like to find the way, I","never can get back by day, Nor can remember plain and",clear The curious music that I hear.
Whenever the moon and stars are,"set, Whenever the wind is high, All night long in the","dark and wet, A man goes riding by."
Late in the night when the,"fires are out, Why does he gallop",and gallop about?
"Whenever the trees are crying aloud,","And ships are tossed at sea, By, on the highway, low","and loud, By at the gallop goes he."
By at the gallop he,"goes, and then By he comes back at",the gallop again.
A birdie with a yellow bill Hopped,"up on the window sill, Cocked his shining eye","and said: 'Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?"
' The rain is,raining all,around.
It falls on field and,"tree, It rains on the umbrellas here,",And on the ships at sea.
"Little Indian, Sioux","or Crow, Little frosty Eskimo, Little","Turk or Japanee, O!"
don't you wish,that you,were me?
You have seen the scarlet trees And the,"lions over seas; You have eaten ostrich eggs,",And turned the turtles off their legs.
"Such a life is very fine, But it's","not so nice as mine: You must often, as you trod,",Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.
"You have curious things to eat,",I am fed on proper meat; You must dwell beyond,"the foam, But I am safe and live at home."
When I am grown to man's estate,"I shall be very proud and great, And tell the other",girls and boys Not to meddle with my toys.
I have a little shadow that,"goes in and out with me, And what can be the",use of him is more than I can see.
"He is very, very like me, from",the heels up to the head; And I see him jump before,"me, when I jump into my bed."
He hasn't got a notion of how,"children ought to play, And can only make a",fool of me in every sort of way.
"He stays so close beside me, he's a coward",you can see; I'd think shame to stick to nursie,as that shadow sticks to me!
The sun is not a-bed when I At night,upon my pillow lie; Still round the earth his way,"he takes, And morning after morning makes."
"While here at home in shining day, We round","the sunny garden play, Each little Indian sleepy-head",Is being kissed and put to bed.
"And when at eve I rise from tea, Day dawns",beyond the Atlantic Sea; And all the children in the,West Are getting up and being dressed.
Smooth it slides upon,"its travel, Here a wimple, there a gleam--",O the clean gravel!
O the,smooth,stream!
"Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,",Paven pools as clear as air-- How a,child wishes To live down there!
See the rings pursue each other;,"All below grows black as night, Just as if mother",Had blown out the light!
"Patience, children, just a minute--",See the spreading circles die; The stream,and all in it Will clear by-and-by.
Of speckled eggs the birdie sings,And nests among the trees; The sailor sings of,ropes and things In ships upon the seas.
"The children sing in far Japan, The",children sing in Spain; The organ with the organ,man Is singing in the rain.
My bed is like a little boat;,Nurse helps me in when I embark; She girds me in,my sailor's coat And starts me in the dark.
"At night, I go on board and say Good",night to all my friends on shore; I shut my eyes and sail,away And see and hear no more.
"And sometimes things to bed I take, As",prudent sailors have to do; Perhaps a slice,"of wedding-cake, Perhaps a toy or two."
All night across the dark we steer: But,"when the day returns at last Safe in my room, beside","the pier, I find my vessel fast."
"Over the borders, a sin without pardon, Breaking","the branches and crawling below, Out through the breach in the wall of the","garden, Down by the banks of the river, we go."
"Here is the mill with the humming of thunder, Here is","the weir with the wonder of foam, Here is the sluice with the race running","under-- Marvelous places, though handy to home!"
"Years may go by, and the",wheel in the river Wheel as it wheels,"for us, children, to-day."
Wheel and keep roaring and,foaming for ever Long after,all of the boys are away.
"Home from the Indies and home from the ocean, Heroes",and soldiers we all shall come home; Still we shall find the old mill wheel in,"motion, Turning and churning that river to foam."
"You with the bean that I gave when we quarreled, I","with your marble of Saturday last, Honored and old and all gaily","apparelled, Here we shall meet and remember the past."
When children are playing alone,"on the green, In comes the playmate",that never was seen.
When children are happy and,"lonely and good, The Friend of the Children",comes out of the wood.
"Nobody heard him and nobody saw, His is a","picture you never could draw, But he's sure to be present, abroad or at","home, When children are happy and playing alone."
I saw you toss the kites on high And blow the,"birds about the sky; And all around I heard you pass, Like ladies'","skirts across the grass-- O wind, a-blowing all day long!"
"O wind,",that sings so,loud a song!
I saw the different,"things you did, But always you",yourself you hid.
"I felt you push, I heard you call,","I could not see yourself at all-- O wind, a-blowing all day","long, O wind, that sings so loud a song!"
O you that are so,"strong and cold, O blower,",are you young or old?
Are you a beast of,"field and tree, Or just a stronger",child than me?
"O wind, a-blowing all","day long, O wind, that sings",so loud a song!
"I woke before the morning, I","was happy all the day, I never said an ugly","word, but smiled and stuck to play."
And now at last the sun is going,"down behind the wood, And I am very","happy, for I know that I've been good."
"My bed is waiting cool and fresh,","with linen smooth and fair, And I must off to","sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer."
"I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the","sun arise, No ugly dream shall fright my","mind, no ugly sight my eyes."
"But slumber hold me tightly, till","I waken in the dawn, And hear the thrushes",singing in the lilacs round the lawn.
"Children, you are very little, And","your bones are very brittle; If you would grow great and stately,",You must try to walk sedately.
"You must still be bright and quiet, And content","with simple diet; And remain, through all bewild'ring,",Innocent and honest children.
"Happy hearts and happy faces, Happy","play in grassy places-- That was how, in ancient ages,",Children grew to kings and sages.
"But the unkind and the unruly, And","the sort who eat unduly, They must never hope for",glory-- Theirs is quite a different story!
"Cruel children, crying babies, All grow","up as geese and gabies, Hated, as their age","increases, By their nephews and their nieces."
"Summer fading, winter comes-- Frosty","mornings, tingling thumbs, Window robins, winter","rooks, And the picture story-books."
Water now is turned to stone,Nurse and I can walk upon; Still we find the,flowing brooks In the picture story-books.
All the pretty things put by,"Wait upon the childrens' eye, Sheep and shepherds, trees and","crooks, In the picture story-books."
"We may see how all things are,","Seas and cities, near and far, And the flying fairies'","looks, In the picture story-books."
How am I to sing your,"praise, Happy chimney-corner days, Sitting safe in","nursery nooks, Reading picture story-books?"
How do you like to,"go up in a swing, Up in",the air so blue?
"Oh, I do think it the",pleasantest thing Ever,a child can do!
It is very nice to think The world,is full of meat and drink With little children saying,grace In every Christian kind of place.
The lamps now glitter down the street; Faintly,sound the falling feet And the blue even slowly,falls About the garden trees and walls.
Now in the falling of the gloom The,red fire paints the empty room; And warmly on the roof,"it looks, And flickers on the backs of books."
Armies march by tower and spire Of,"cities blazing, in the fire;-- Till as I gaze with staring","eyes, The armies fade, the lustre dies."
Then once again the glow returns;,Again the phantom city burns; And down,"the red-hot valley, lo!"
The phantom,armies marching,go!
"Blinking embers, tell me true Where are","those armies marching to, And what the burning city",is That crumbles in your furnaces!
Down by a shining water,"well I found a very little dell, No",higher than my head.
The heather and the gorse,"about In summer bloom were coming out,",Some yellow and some red.
I called the little pool a,sea; The little hills were big to me;,For I am very small.
"I made a boat, I made","a town, I searched the caverns up and","down, And named them one and all."
"And all about was mine,","I said, The little sparrows overhead,","The little minnows, too."
This was the world and I was,"king; For me the bees came by to sing,",For me the swallows flew.
I played there were no deeper,"seas, Nor any wider plains than these,",Nor other kings than me.
At last I heard my mother,"call Out from the house at evenfall, To",call me home to tea.
And I must rise and leave,"my dell, And leave my dimpled water well,",And leave my heather blooms.
"and as my home I neared, How","very big my nurse appeared, How",great and cool the rooms!
All round the house is the jet-black night; It,"stares through the window-pane; It crawls in the corners, hiding from the","light, And it moves with the moving flame."
"Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum, With","the breath of Bogie in my hair, And all round the candle the crooked","shadows come, And go marching along up the stair."
"The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the","lamp, The shadow of the child that goes to bed-- All the wicked shadows","coming, tramp, tramp, tramp, With the black night overhead."
"Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, A frosty,",fiery sleepy-head; Blinks but an hour or two;,"and then, A blood-red orange, sets again."
"Before the stars have left the skies, At",morning in the dark I rise; And shivering in my,"nakedness, By the cold candle, bathe and dress."
Close by the jolly fire I sit,"To warm my frozen bones a bit; Or with a reindeer-sled,",explore The colder countries round the door.
"When to go out, my nurse doth wrap Me in",my comforter and cap; The cold wind burns my face and,blows Its frosty pepper up my nose.
Black are my steps on silver sod; Thick blows,"my frosty breath abroad; And tree and house, and hill","and lake, Are frosted like a wedding-cake."
I can in the,sorrel sit Where the,ladybird alit.
I can climb the jointed grass; And on high,"See the greater swallows pass In the sky, And the round sun",rolling by Heeding no such things as I.
"Through that forest I can pass Till, as in a","looking-glass, Humming fly and daisy tree And my tiny self I see, Painted",very clear and neat On the rain-pool at my feet.
Should a leaflet come to land Drifting,"near to where I stand, Straight I'll board that tiny",boat Round the rain-pool sea to float.
Little thoughtful creatures sit On,the grassy coasts of it; Little things with lovely,eyes See me sailing with surprise.
Some are clad in armour,green-- (These have sure to battle,been!
")-- Some are pied with ev'ry hue, Black","and crimson, gold and blue; Some have wings and swift are",gone; But they all look kindly on.
"Last, to the chamber where I lie My","fearful footsteps patter nigh, And come from out the cold and",gloom Into my warm and cheerful room.
"There, safe arrived, we turn about To keep","the coming shadows out, And close the happy door at",last On all the perils that we passed.
"Then, when mamma goes by to bed, She shall","come in with tip-toe tread, And see me lying warm and",fast And in the Land of Nod at last.
"When the golden day is done, Through","the closing portal, Child and garden, flower","and sun, Vanish all things mortal."
"As the blinding showers fall,","As the rays diminish, Under evening's cloak they",all Roll away and vanish.
"Garden darkened, daisy shut,","Child in bed, they slumber-- Glow-worm in the highway","rut, Mice among the lumber."
"In the darkness houses shine, Parents","move with candles Till on all, the night divine",Turns the bedroom handles.
Till at last the day begins,"In the east a-breaking, In the hedges and",the whins Sleeping birds a-waking.
"In the darkness shapes of things, Houses,","trees and hedges, Clearer grow; and sparrow's",wings Beat on window ledges.
"These shall wake the yawning maid,",She the door shall open-- Finding dew on garden,glade And the morning broken.
There my garden grows again Green and,"rosy painted, As at eve behind the",pane From my eyes it fainted.
"Just as it was shut away,","Toy-like, in the even, Here I see it glow with",day Under glowing heaven.
Every path and every,"plot, Every bush of roses, Every",blue forget-me-not Where the dew reposes.
"they cry, 'the day is come On the",smiling valleys; We have beat the morning,"drum; Playmate, join your allies!"
' Birds all the sunny day Flutter,and quarrel Here in the arbor-like,Tent of the laurel.
Here in the fork The brown,nest is seated; Four little blue eggs,The mother keeps heated.
"While we stand watching her, Staring","like gabies, Safe in each egg are the",Bird's little babies.
"Soon the frail eggs they shall Chip,",and upspringing Make all the April,woods Merry with singing.
"Younger than we are, O children,","and frailer, Soon in blue air they'll be,",Singer and sailor.
"We, so much older, Taller","and stronger, We shall look down on",the Birdies no longer.
They shall go flying With,musical speeches High over head in,the Tops of the beeches.
In spite of our wisdom,"And sensible talking, We on our feet",must go Plodding and walking.
All the names I know from nurse:,"Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse, Bachelor's","buttons, Lady's smock, And the Lady Hollyhock."
"Fairy places, fairy things, Fairy","woods where the wild bee wings, Tiny trees for tiny",dames-- These must all be fairy names!
Tiny woods below whose boughs Shady,"fairies weave a house; Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme, Where",the braver fairies climb!
"Fair are grown-up people's trees, But the","fairest woods are these; Where if I were not so tall,",I should live for good and all.
"Here is a child who clambers and scrambles, All",by himself and gathering brambles; Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;,And there is the green for stringing the daisies!
Here is a cart run away in the road Lumping,along with man and load; And here is a mill and there is a,"river, Each a glimpse and gone forever!"
This whistle,we made (and how clearly,it sounds!
) By the side of a,field at the end,of the grounds.
"Of a branch of a plane, with a","knife of my own, It was nursie who","made it, and nursie alone!"
What are you,able to build,with your blocks?
Castles and,"palaces, temples",and docks.
Rain may keep raining and others,"go roam, But I can be happy",and building at home.
This one is sailing and,that one is moored: Hark to the song,of the sailors on board!
And see the steps of my,"palace, the kings Coming and going",with presents and things!
Now I have,"done with it, down",let it go!
All in,a moment the town,is laid low.
Block upon block lying,"scattered and free, What is there left of",my town by the sea?
"The gardener does not love to talk, He makes","me keep the gravel walk; And when he puts his tools away,",He locks the door and takes the key.
Away behind the currant row Where,"no one else but cook may go, Far in the plots, I see","him dig, Old and serious, brown and big."
"He digs the flowers,","green, red and blue, Nor wishes",to be spoken to.
He digs the flowers,"and cuts the hay, And never",seems to want to play.
"summer goes, And winter comes","with pinching toes, When in the garden bare",and brown You must lay your barrow down.
"Well now, and while the summer stays, To profit","by these garden days, O how much wiser you would be To",play at Indian wars with me!
"Here's peace for you,",and surety; here the one,Wisdom -- the truth!
"-- ""All day the good glad sun Showers love","and labour on you, wine and song; The greenwood laughs,","the wind blows, all day long Till night."

Then shall be No lamp relumed,"in heaven, no voices crying, Or changing","lights, or dreams and forms that hover!"
"(And, heart, for all your sighing,",That gladness and those tears are,"over, over."

Do they,"still whisper, the",old weary cries?
"""'MID YOUTH AND SONG, FEASTING AND CARNIVAL, THROUGH LAUGHTER, THROUGH","THE ROSES, AS OF OLD COMES DEATH, ON SHADOWY AND RELENTLESS FEET, DEATH,","UNAPPEASABLE BY PRAYER OR GOLD; DEATH IS THE END, THE END!"

"Yet, behind the night, Waits for","the great unborn, somewhere afar, Some",white tremendous daybreak.
"Tenderly, day that I have loved,","I close your eyes, And smooth your quiet","brow, and fold your thin dead hands."
The grey veils,of the half-light deepen;,colour dies.
"I bear you, a light burden, to the shrouded","sands, Where lies your waiting boat, by wreaths of the sea's making Mist-garlanded,",with all grey weeds of the water crowned.
"Beyond the shifting cold twilight,","Further than laughter goes, or tears, further than dreaming,","There'll be no port, no dawn-lit islands!"
But the drear Waste,"darkening, and, at length, flame",ultimate on the deep.
"Oh, the last fire","-- and you, unkissed, unfriended",there!
"Oh, the lone","way's red ending, and we",not there to weep!
"(We found you pale and quiet,","and strangely crowned with flowers, Lovely",and secret as a child.

")  Void now and tenebrous,",The grey sands curve before,me.
"From the inland meadows, Fragrant of June and clover, floats","the dark, and fills The hollow sea's dead face with little creeping shadows,",And the white silence brims the hollow of the hills.
Close in the nest is folded every,"weary wing, Hushed all the joyful voices; and we, who held you dear,","Eastward we turn and homeward, alone, remembering ."
Day that I,"loved, day that I","loved, the Night is here!"
I cower,"to the earth, I waking,",I only.
High and cold,"thou dreamest, O queen, high-dreaming",and lonely.
And around,me the feet of thy,watchers tread.
There is a rumour and a radiance,"of wings above my head, An intolerable",radiance of wings.
"All the earth grows fire,",White lips of desire Brushing cool,"on the forehead, croon slumbrous things."
Earth fades; and the air,"is thrilled with ways, Dewy",paths full of comfort.
from quiet skies In,through the window my,Lord the Sun!
And my eyes Were dazzled and drunk with,"the misty gold, The golden glory that drowned and",crowned me Eddied and swayed through the room .
"Around me, To left and to right, Hunched","figures and old, Dull blear-eyed scribbling fools, grew fair,",Ringed round and haloed with holy light.
Till the light faded; And they were,"but fools again, fools unknowing, Still scribbling,",blear-eyed and stolid immortals.
"I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,","And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover, And heard","the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry."
And in them all was only,"the old cry, That song they always","sing -- ""The best is over!"
You may remember,"now, and think, and sigh, O",silly lover!
""" And I was tired and sick that all was over,","And because I, For all my thinking, never could recover",One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry,"and sick, and wished",to die.
"Then from the sad west turning wearily, I saw the","pines against the white north sky, Very beautiful, and still, and bending",over Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
"And there was peace in them; and I Was happy, and","forgot to play the lover, And laughed, and did no longer wish to","die; Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!"
"Creeps in half wanton,","half asleep, One with a fat",wide hairless face.
He likes love-music that is cheap;,Likes women in a crowded place; And,wants to hear the noise they're making.
His heavy eyelids,"droop half-over, Great pouches swing",beneath his eyes.
"He listens, thinks himself the","lover, Heaves from his stomach wheezy",sighs; He likes to feel his heart's a-breaking.
His little,lips are bright,with slime.
The,music,swells.
The,women,shiver.
"And all the while, in","perfect time, His pendulous",stomach hangs a-shaking.
All the shade,Is rife with magic,and movement.
I stray alone Here,"on the edge of silence, half afraid,",Waiting a sign.
In the deep heart of me,"The sullen waters swell towards the moon,",And all my tides set seaward.
From inland Leaps a gay fragment of some,"mocking tune, That tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand,",And dies between the seawall and the sea.
Song of a tribe of the ancient,Egyptians (The Priests within the Temple) She was wrinkled,and huge and hideous?
She,was our,Mother.
She was,lustful and,lewd?
-- but a,God; we had none,other.
"In the day She was hidden and dumb,",but at nightfall moaned in the shade; We shuddered and gave,Her Her will in the darkness; we were afraid.
(The People without) She sent us,"pain, And we bowed before Her; She smiled",again And bade us adore Her.
She solaced our woe,And soothed our sighing; And what,shall we do Now God is dying?
(The Priests within) She was,hungry and ate our children;,-- how should we stay Her?
She took our young,men and our maidens; -- ours,to obey Her.
We were loathed and mocked,and reviled of all nations;,that was our pride.
"She fed us, protected","us, loved us, and killed",us; now She has died.
(The People without),She was so strong; But death,is stronger.
She ruled,us long; But Time,is longer.
(Halted around the fire,"by night, after moon-set, they sing",this beneath the trees.
) What light of unremembered skies,"Hast thou relumed within our eyes,","Thou whom we seek, whom we shall find?"
"A certain odour on the wind, Thy hidden","face beyond the west, These things have called us; on a quest Older than","any road we trod, More endless than desire."
"Far God, Sigh with thy cruel","voice, that fills The soul with longing for dim",hills And faint horizons!
For there come Grey moments of the antient,"dumb Sickness of travel, when no song Can cheer us; but",the way seems long; And one remembers.
the beat Of weary,"unreturning feet, And songs",of pilgrims unreturning!
The fires we,left are always burning On,the old shrines of home.
"Our kin Have built them temples, and therein",Pray to the Gods we know; and dwell In little houses,"lovable, Being happy (we remember how!"
) And peaceful,even to,death.
"O Thou, God of all long desirous","roaming, Our hearts are sick of fruitless homing,",And crying after lost desire.
as with fire,Consuming dreams of,other bliss.
"(Sung, on one night,","in the cities,",in the darkness.
Ye are sober and dull,"through the common day, But",now it is night!
It is shameful,"night, and God is",asleep!
(Have you not felt the quick fires that,"creep Through the hungry flesh, and the lust of delight,",And hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say?
The house is,dumb; The night calls out,to you.
"Down the dim stairs, through","the creaking door, Naked, crawling on hands",and feet -- It is meet!
Ye are men no,"longer, but less and","more, Beast and God."
"Down the lampless street, By little black ways,","and secret places, In the darkness and mire, Faint laughter","around, and evil faces By the star-glint seen -- ah!"
For the darkness whispers,"a blind desire, And the fingers",of night are amorous.
Because God put His adamantine fate Between,"my sullen heart and its desire, I swore that I would burst the Iron","Gate, Rise up, and curse Him on His throne of fire."
An idle wind blew round,an empty throne And stirred the heavy,curtains on the walls.
"Before thy shrine I kneel, an unknown","worshipper, Chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies, Incense","of dirges, prayers that are as holy myrrh."
"Ah, goddess, on thy throne of tears and faint low","sighs, Weary at last to theeward come the feet that err, And empty",hearts grown tired of the world's vanities.
How fair this cool deep silence to,a wanderer Deaf with the roar of,winds along the open skies!
"Sweet, after sting and bitter","kiss of sea-water, The pale Lethean wine",within thy chalices!
(From the train between,"Bologna and Milan,",second class.
) Opposite,me two Germans,snore and sweat.
Through sullen,swirling gloom we jolt and,roar.
We have been here for,ever:  even yet A dim watch tells two,"hours, two aeons, more."
The windows are,tight-shut and slimy-wet With,a night's foetor.
There are two hours,more; Two hours to dawn and,Milan; two hours yet.
Opposite,me two Germans sweat,and snore.
One of,"them wakes, and spits, and",sleeps again.
The,darkness,shivers.
A wan light through,"the rain Strikes on our faces,",drawn and white.
"Somewhere A new day sprawls; and,","inside, the foul air Is chill, and damp,",and fouler than before.
"Out of the nothingness of sleep, The","slow dreams of Eternity, There was a thunder on","the deep: I came, because you called to me."
"I broke the Night's primeval bars, I","dared the old abysmal curse, And flashed through ranks of frightened",stars Suddenly on the universe!
The eternal,silences were broken; Hell,became Heaven as I passed.
-- What shall I give you,"as a token, A sign that","we have met, at last?"
"I'll break and forge the stars anew, Shatter",the heavens with a song; Immortal in my love for,"you, Because I love you, very strong."
"Then only in the empty spaces, Death,","walking very silently, Shall fear the glory of our",faces Through all the dark infinity.
"So, clothed about with perfect love, The","eternal end shall find us one, Alone above","the Night, above The dust of the dead gods, alone."
We leave this resting-place,Made fair by one another,for a while.
"Now, for a god-speed, one last mad","embrace; The long road then, unlit",by your faint smile.
and you,so far,away!
"Oh,",I'll,remember!
each crawling day Will pale a,"little your scarlet lips, each mile Dull the",dear pain of your remembered face.
Some day I shall rise and leave my friends And seek,"you again through the world's far ends, You whom I found so",fair (Touch of your hands and smell of your hair!
"), My only",god in the,days that were.
"My eager feet shall find you again, Though",the sullen years and the mark of pain Have changed you wholly; for,I shall know (How could I forget having loved you so?
"), In the sad half-light","of evening, The face that was",all my sunrising.
"), And I loved you before you were old","and wise, When the flame of youth was strong in your eyes, -- And",my heart is sick with memories.
"Death will find me, long before I tire",Of watching you; and swing me suddenly Into the shade,and loneliness and mire Of the last land!
"There, waiting patiently, One day, I think, I'll feel a","cool wind blowing, See a slow light across the Stygian tide, And hear","the Dead about me stir, unknowing, And tremble."
"-- And turn, and toss your","brown delightful head Amusedly, among",the ancient Dead.
I said I,splendidly loved,you; it's not true.
Such long swift,tides stir not,a land-locked sea.
On gods or fools the high risk,falls -- on you -- The clean clear bitter-sweet,that's not for me.
Love soars from,earth to ecstasies,unwist.
Love is flung,Lucifer-like from,Heaven to Hell.
Pleasure's,"not theirs, nor",pain.
"They doubt, and","sigh, And do not love",at all.
Of,these am,I.
or,that foul,you?
"But this the strange gods, who had","given so much, To have seen and known","you, this they might not do."
"One last shame's spared me, one",black word's unspoken; And I'm alone; and,you have not awoken.
"-- One moment,",what it is,to love.
And yet -- the best that either's,"known Will change, and wither, and be less, At last, than","comfort, or its own Remembrance."
And when some caress Tendered in habit,"(once a flame All heaven sang out to) wakes the shame Unworded, in the","steady eyes We'll have, -- THAT day, what shall we do?"
"Being so noble,",kill the two Who've reached their,second-best?
"Being wise, Break","cleanly off, and",get away.
Follow down,other windier skies,"New lures, alone?"
"Or shall we stay, Since this is all","we've known, content In the lean twilight of such day,","And not remember, not lament?"
"So I, from paint, stone, tale, and rhyme,","Stuffed love's infinity, And sucked all lovers of all",time To rarify ecstasy.
Helen's the hair shuts out from me,Verona's livid skies; Gypsy the lips I press;,and see Two Antonys in your eyes.
In a cool curving,world he lies And ripples,with dark ecstasies.
There slipping,"wave and shore are one, And",weed and mud.
And,all's,one.
"Gentle, embracing, quiet,","dun, The world he rests in, world he knows,",Perpetual curving.
"Space is no more,",under the mud; His bliss is older,than the sun.
Silent,and straight the waters,run.
"The lights, the cries, the","willows dim, And the dark",tide are one with him.
How,can,we find?
how,can we,rest?
"how can We,","being gods, win joy, or peace,",being man?
Love's,for,completeness!
"No perfection grows 'Twixt leg, and arm, elbow,","and ear, and nose, And joint, and socket; but unsatisfied Sprawling","desires, shapeless, perverse, denied."
"How can love triumph, how","can solace be, Where fever turns","toward fever, knee toward knee?"
And I,went,on.
"For if my echoing footfall slept, Soon a far",whispering there'd be Of a little lonely wind that crept From tree to,"tree, and distantly Followed me, followed me."
But the blue vaporous end of,"day Brought peace, and pursuit baffled quite,",Where between pine-woods dipped the way.
"I turned,",slipped in and,out of sight.
I trod,as quiet as,the night.
The pine-boles kept perpetual,hush; And in the boughs wind never,swirled.
I found a flowering lowly,"bush, And bowed, slid in, and sighed and curled, Hidden",at rest from all the world.
I was,"safe, and glad,",I knew!
Yet -- with cold heart,and cold wet brows,I lay.
And,the,dark fell.
There grew Meward a sound of shaken,"boughs; And ceased, above my intricate house; And","silence, silence, silence found me."
I felt the,unfaltering movement,creep Among the leaves.
They shed around me,"Calm clouds of scent, that I did",weep; And stroked my face.
I,fell,asleep.
"Breathless, we flung us","on the windy hill, Laughed in the","sun, and kissed the lovely grass."
"You said, ""Through glory and","ecstasy we pass; Wind, sun, and earth remain, the","birds sing still, When we are old, are old."
"""  ""And when we die All's over that is ours;","and life burns on Through other lovers, other lips,"" said I,","-- ""Heart of my heart, our heaven is now, is won!"
""" ""We are","Earth's best, that learnt her lesson",here.
Life,is our,cry.
We,have kept,the faith!
""" we said; ""We shall go",down with unreluctant tread,Rose-crowned into the darkness!
"Proud we were, And","laughed, that had such brave",true things to say.
-- And then you,"suddenly cried, and",turned away.
I dreamt I was in love again,"With the One Before the Last, And smiled to greet the pleasant",pain Of that innocent young past.
But I jumped to feel how sharp had,"been The pain when it did live, How the faded dreams",of Nineteen-ten Were Hell in Nineteen-five.
"The boy's woe was as keen and clear, The","boy's love just as true, And the One Before the Last,","my dear, Hurt quite as much as you."
Sickly I pondered how the lover,"Wrongs the unanswering tomb, And sentimentalizes",over What earned a better doom.
Gently he tombs the poor dim,"last time, Strews pinkish dust above, And","sighs, ""The dear dead boyish pastime!"
But THIS,"-- ah,",God!
""" -- Better oblivion hide dead true loves,","Better the night enfold, Than men, to eke the praise","of new loves, Should lie about the old!"
bitter,thoughts I had,in plenty.
But here's the worst of,"it -- I shall forget, in Nineteen-twenty, YOU",ever hurt abit!
"The stars, a jolly company, I","envied, straying late and lonely; And cried upon their","revelry: ""O white companionship!"
"You only In love, in","faith unbroken dwell, Friends radiant",and inseparable!
"But I, remembering, pitied","well And loved them, who, with lonely light, In empty","infinite spaces dwell, Disconsolate."
"For, all the night, I heard","the thin gnat-voices cry, Star to faint","star, across the sky."
"He wakes, who never","thought to wake again, Who held",the end was Death.
"He opens eyes Slowly, to",one long livid oozing plain Closed down by,the strange eyeless heavens.
He lies; And waits; and once in,timeless sick surmise Through the dead air heaves,"up an unknown hand, Like a dry branch."
I thought when,"love for you died,",I should die.
"Alone, most","strangely, I",live on.
Was Called Ambarvalia Swings the way still by,"hollow and hill, And all the world's a song; ""She's far,"" it sings me, ""but","fair,"" it rings me, ""Quiet,"" it laughs, ""and strong!"
spite of the miles and years between,"us, Spite of your chosen part, I do remember;",and I go With laughter in my heart.
So above the little folk that know,"not, Out of the white hill-town, High up I clamber; and",I remember; And watch the day go down.
"They'll call the news from hill to hill,","Dark and uncomforted, Earth and sky and the winds;",and I Shall know that you are dead.
"I shall not hear your trentals, Nor eat",your arval bread; For the kin of you will surely,do Their duty by the dead.
Their little dull greasy,"eyes will water; They'll paw you,",and gulp afresh.
They'll sniffle and,"weep, and their thoughts will creep Like",flies on the cold flesh.
"They will put pence on your grey eyes,","Bind up your fallen chin, And lay you straight, the fools",that loved you Because they were your kin.
"They will praise all the bad about you,","And hush the good away, And wonder how they'll do without","you, And then they'll go away."
"With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,","And dim and decorous mirth, With ham and sherry, they'll",meet to bury The lordliest lass of earth.
The little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving,"Behind lone-riding you, The heart so high, the heart so living,",Heart that they never knew.
"I shall not hear your trentals, Nor","eat your arval bread, Nor with smug breath tell lies of",death To the unanswering dead.
With snuffle and sniff and,"handkerchief, The folk who loved you not Will bury","you, and go wondering Back home."
And,you will,rot.
"But laughing and half-way up to heaven,","With wind and hill and star, I yet shall keep, before","I sleep, Your Ambarvalia."
There was a damned,successful Poet; There was,a Woman like the Sun.
And,they,were dead.
They,did not know,it.
They did not,know their time,was done.
They did not know his hymns Were,"silence; and her limbs, That had served Love so","well, Dust, and a filthy smell."
So knee to knee they sped,"again, And laugh to laugh they ran, I'm","told, Across the streets of Hell ."
And then They suddenly felt the wind blow,"cold, And knew, so closely pressed, Chill air on lip and breast, And,","with a sick surprise, The emptiness of eyes."
"Here, where love's stuff is","body, arm and side Are stabbing-sweet",'gainst chair and lamp and wall.
In every touch more,intimate meanings hide; And flaming,brains are the white heart of all.
"Here, million pulses to one centre beat: Closed in by","men's vast friendliness, alone, Two can be drunk with solitude, and",meet On the sheer point where sense with knowing's one.
"though the woods are quiet,",and you've heard Night creep along,the hedges.
Never go Where tangled,"foliage shrouds the crying bird, And the","remote winds sigh, and waters flow!"
For moveless limbs no,"pity I crave, That",never were swift!
"Still all I prize, Laughter and thought and friends,",I have; No fool to heave luxurious sighs For,the woods and hills that I never knew.
The more,excellent,way's yet mine!
And you Flower-laden come to,"the clean white cell, And we talk as ever",-- am I not the same?
"With our hearts we love,","immutable, You without","pity, I without shame."
We talk as of old; as of old you go Out,"under the sky, and laughing, I know, Flit through the streets, your heart all",me; Till you gain the world beyond the town.
Then -- I fade from your,"heart, quietly; And your",fleet steps quicken.
The strong down Smiles you welcome there;,the woods that love you Close lovely and,conquering arms above you.
"O ever-moving,",O lithe,and free!
Fast in my linen prison I press,"On impassable bars, or emptily",Laugh in my great loneliness.
And still in the white neat bed I strive Most,"impotently against that gyve; Being less now than a thought, even,",To you alone with your hills and heaven.
I Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus,"broke To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate On that adulterous",whore a ten years' hate And a king's honour.
"Through red death, and smoke, And cries, and then","by quieter ways he strode, Till the still",innermost chamber fronted him.
"He swung his sword, and crashed into","the dim Luxurious bower,",flaming like a god.
High sat white,"Helen, lonely",and serene.
He had not remembered that she,"was so fair, And that her neck curved down in such",a way; And he felt tired.
"He flung the sword away, And","kissed her feet, and knelt before her there, The",perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.
II So,far the,poet.
How should he behold,"That journey home, the long",connubial years?
He does not tell you how white Helen,"bears Child on legitimate child, becomes","a scold, Haggard with virtue."
Menelaus bold,"Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred",Troys 'Twixt noon and supper.
And her golden,voice Got shrill as he,grew deafer.
And,both,were old.
Often he wonders,"why on earth he went Troyward, or why",poor Paris ever came.
"Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed",and impotent; Her dry shanks twitch,at Paris' mumbled name.
So Menelaus nagged;,and Helen cried; And Paris slept on,by Scamander side.
How should,I,know?
The enormous wheels,of will Drove me cold-eyed on tired,and sleepless feet.
Night was void arms and,"you a phantom still, And day your far",light swaying down the street.
As never fool for,"love, I starved for you; My throat was dry and",my eyes hot to see.
Your mouth so lying was most,"heaven in view, And your remembered",smell most agony.
I felt your hot wrist shiver,And suddenly the mad victory I planned Flashed,"real, in your burning bending head."
My conqueror's blood was cool as a deep,river In shadow; and my heart beneath your hand,Quieter than a dead man on a bed.
Day after day you'll sit with him and note The,"greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat; As prettiness turns to","pomp, and strength to fat, And love, love, love to habit!"
"O lithe and free And lightfoot,","that the poor heart cries to see, That's how",I'll see your man and you!
"-- But you -- Oh, when","THAT time comes, you'll",be dirty too!
"My restless blood now lies a-quiver, Knowing that","always, exquisitely, This April twilight on the river",Stirs anguish in the heart of me.
"And all these, like a waiting lover,","Murmur and gleam, lift lustrous eyes, Drift close to me, and",sideways bending Whisper delicious words.
But I Stretch terrible,"hands, uncomprehending, Shaken with",love; and laugh; and cry.
And Hatred followed,"after, Shrilling madly",down the breeze.
"In peace from the wild heart of clamour, A","flower in moonlight, she was there, Was rippling down white ways",of glamour Quietly laid on wave and air.
Her passing,left no,leaf a-quiver.
Pale flowers,"wreathed her white,",white brows.
Her feet were,silence on the,"river; And ""Hush!"
""" she","said, between",the boughs.
In darkness the loud sea,"makes moan; And earth is shaken, and all evils",creep About her ways.
"Oh, now",to know you,sleep!
Your magic and your beauty and,"your strength, Like hills at noon or sunlight on a","tree, Sleeping prevail in earth and air."
In the sweet gloom above the brown and white,Night benedictions hover; and the winds of night Move,"gently round the room, and watch you there."
And still,the darkness ebbs about,your bed.
"Quiet, and","strange, and loving-kind,",you sleep.
And holy joy about,the earth is shed; And holiness,upon the deep.
"From the candles and dumb shadows,","And the house where love had died, I stole to the vast moonlight",And the whispering life outside.
"But I found no lips of comfort, No home","in the moon's light (I, little and lone and frightened In the unfriendly","night), And no meaning in the voices."
Far over the lands and,"through The dark, beyond the ocean, I",willed to think of YOU!
"For I knew, had you been with me I'd","have known the words of night, Found peace of heart, gone",gladly In comfort of that light.
But ever Desperately,I willed; Till all grew soft and,far And silent .
And suddenly I found you,"white and radiant, Sleeping quietly,",Far out through the tides of darkness.
"Love,"" they said,","""is King of Kings, And Triumph",is his crown.
Earth fades in flame before,"his wings, And Sun and",Moon bow down.
""" -- But that, I knew, would",never do; And Heaven,is all too high.
So whenever I,"meet a Queen, I said, I will",not catch her eye.
"Love,"" they said, and ""Love,"" they said, ""The gift",of Love is this; A crown of thorns about thy,"head, And vinegar to thy kiss!"
""" -- But Tragedy",is not for me; And I'm content,to be gay.
So whenever I,"spied a Tragic Lady, I",went another way.
And so I never feared to see,"You wander down the street, Or come across the",fields to me On ordinary feet.
"For what they'd never told me of,",And what I never knew; It was that all the,"time, my love, Love would be merely you."
Safe in the magic,"of my woods I lay, and watched",the dying light.
"Faint in the pale high solitudes,","And washed with rain and veiled by night, Silver",and blue and green were showing.
"The spell was broken, the key denied",me And at length your flat clear voice beside me,Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.
You came and,quacked beside me,in the wood.
"You said, ""The",view from here is,very good!
""" You said, ""It's",nice to be alone,a bit!
""" And, ""How",the days are,drawing out!
"You said,","""The sunset's pretty, isn't",it?
I wish,-- I wish that you,were dead!
"Lip and eye Flashed on the glory, shone and","cried, Improvident, unmemoried; And fitfully and like",a flame The light of laughter went and came.
Proud in their careless,transience moved The changing,faces that I loved.
"Till suddenly, and","otherwhence, I looked upon",your innocence.
For lifted clear and still and strange From,the dark woven flow of change Under a vast and starless sky,I saw the immortal moment lie.
"One instant I,","an instant, knew",As God knows all.
And it,"and you I, above","Time, oh, blind!"
could see,In witless,immortality.
"I saw the marble cup; the tea, Hung on","the air, an amber stream; I saw the fire's unglittering","gleam, The painted flame, the frozen smoke."
Light was more,alive,than you.
"For suddenly, and","otherwhence, I looked on your",magnificence.
Dazed at length Human,"eyes grew, mortal strength Wearied; and",Time began to creep.
Change closed,about me,like a sleep.
Light glinted,on the eyes,I loved.
The cup,was,filled.
The,bodies,moved.
The drifting,petal came,to ground.
The laughter,chimed its perfect,round.
The broken,syllable,was ended.
"And I, so certain and so","friended, How could I cloud, or how distress, The heaven",of your unconsciousness?
Or shake at Time's,"sufficient spell, Stammering",of lights unutterable?
The eternal holiness,"of you, The timeless end, you never knew,","The peace that lay, the light that shone."
You never knew that,I had gone A million miles,"away, and stayed A million years."
The laughter played,Unbroken round me;,and the jest Flashed on.
And we that knew the,best Down wonderful hours,grew happier yet.
"I sang at heart, and talked, and","eat, And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,","When you were there, and you, and you."
In a flowered dell,"the Lady Venus stood,",Amazed with sorrow.
Down the morning one Far golden,horn in the gold of trees and sun Rang,out; and held; and died.
She thought the,wood Grew,quieter.
"Wing, and leaf,",and pool of light,Forgot to dance.
Dumb lay the unfalling stream;,Life one eternal instant rose in dream Clear out,"of time, poised on a golden height."
Till a swift,terror broke the,abrupt hour.
The gold waves purled,amidst the green above her;,And a bird sang.
"With one sharp-taken breath, By sunlit branches and","unshaken flower, The immortal limbs flashed to the human lover,",And the immortal eyes to look on death.
The damned,ship lurched,and slithered.
Quiet and quick My cold gorge rose; the long,"sea rolled; I knew I must think hard of something, or be sick;",And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!
"You, you alone",could hold my fancy,ever!
And with you,"memories come,","sharp pain, and dole."
Now there's a,choice -- heartache or,tortured liver!
"A sea-sick body,",or a you-sick,soul!
Do I,forget,you?
Retchings twist and tie,"me, Old meat, good meals, brown","gobbets, up I throw."
Acrid return and,"slimy, The sobs and slobber",of a last years woe.
And still,the sick ship,rolls.
"'Tis hard, I tell ye,","To choose 'twixt love and nausea,",heart and belly.
All night the ways of Heaven,"were desolate, Long roads across a",gleaming empty sky.
"Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,","Alone, serene beyond all love or hate, Terror or triumph,","were content to wait, We, silent and all-knowing."
Suddenly Swept through the heaven,"low-crouching from on high, One horseman, downward",to the earth's low gate.
"Oh, perfect from the ultimate","height of living, Lightly we turned, through wet woods","blossom-hung, Into the open."
"Down the supernal roads, With plumes a-tossing, purple","flags far flung, Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,",Thundered the black battalions of the Gods.
Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered,"throng; And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise,","High-throned you sit, and gracious."
"All day long Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester","Fantasies, And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar","Sighs, Bow to your benediction, go their way."
And the grave jewelled,courtier Memories Worship and,"love and tend you, all the day."
"not now, when desire burns, and the","wind calls, and the suns of spring Light-foot dance in the woods,","whisper of life, woo me to wayfaring; Ah!"
"not now should you come, now when the road","beckons, and good friends call, Where are songs to","be sung, fights to be fought, yea!"
"and the best of all, Love,",on myriad lips fairer than,"yours, kisses you could not give!"
"Dearest, why should I","mourn, whimper, and whine, I",that have yet to live?
"Sorrow will I forget, tears for the best, love on","the lips of you, Now, when dawn in the blood wakes, and the sun laughs",up the eastern blue; I'll forget and be glad!
Still I abode strong,"in a golden dream,",Unrecaptured.
"and, in the","heart of it, End of","labouring, you!"
Therefore I kept,"ready the altar, lit","The flame, burning apart."
Face of my dreams,vainly in vision white Gleaming,"down to me, lo!"
For about midnight Whispers,"grew through the wood suddenly, strange cries in the","boughs above Grated, cries like a laugh."
Silent and black then through the,"sacred grove Great birds flew, as a dream,","troubling the leaves, passing at length."
Therefore I go; never to,"rest, or win Peace, and worship of you more, and the",dumb wood and the shrine therein.
"So light we were, so right we were, so","fair faith shone, And the way was laid so certainly, that, when","I'd gone, What dumb thing looked up at you?"
"Was it something heard, Or a sudden","cry, that meekly and without a word You broke the","faith, and strangely, weakly, slipped apart."
You gave in,"-- you, the proud of heart, unbowed",of heart!
"Was this, friend,",the end of all that,we could do?
And have you found,"the best for you,",the rest for you?
Did you learn,so suddenly,(and I not by!
") Some whispered story, that stole the glory from","the sky, And ended all the splendid dream, and made you go So","dully from the fight we know, the light we know?"
"the faith remains, and",I must pass Gay down the,"way, and on alone."
Under the grass You wait; the breeze,"moves in the trees, and stirs, and calls, And covers you","with white petals, with light petals."
Good,sleep to,you!
We have built,a house that is not for,Time's throwing.
We have gained a,peace unshaken by,pain for ever.
War,knows no,power.
"Safe shall be my going, Secretly armed against",all death's endeavour; Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;,"And if these poor limbs die, safest of all."
"Blow out, you","bugles, over the",rich Dead!
There's none of these so lonely,"and poor of old, But, dying, has made us",rarer gifts than gold.
"Blow,","bugles,",blow!
"They brought us, for","our dearth, Holiness, lacked","so long, and Love, and Pain."
"Honour has come back, as a king, to earth, And",paid his subjects with a royal wage; And Nobleness walks in our,ways again; And we have come into our heritage.
These hearts were woven of,"human joys and cares, Washed marvellously","with sorrow, swift to mirth."
The years,had given them,kindness.
"Dawn was theirs,","And sunset, and the colours",of the earth.
"These had seen movement, and heard music; known Slumber",and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; Felt the quick stir of wonder;,sat alone; Touched flowers and furs and cheeks.
All,this is,ended.
There are waters blown,by changing winds to laughter And,"lit by the rich skies, all day."
"And after, Frost, with a","gesture, stays the waves that dance And",wandering loveliness.
"He leaves a white Unbroken glory,","a gathered radiance, A width, a","shining peace, under the night."
"If I should die, think only",this of me: That there's some corner of a foreign,field That is for ever England.
"Mamua, when our laughter ends, And","hearts and bodies, brown as white, Are dust about the doors of","friends, Or scent ablowing down the night, Then, oh!"
"then, the wise agree,",Comes our,immortality.
"Mamua, there",waits a land Hard for us,to understand.
"Out of time, beyond the sun, All","are one in Paradise, You and Pupure are","one, And Tau, and the ungainly wise."
"And my laughter, and","my pain, Shall home to the",Eternal Brain.
And there'll no more be one who dreams,"Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff, Eyes of illusion,","mouth that seems, All time-entangled human love."
And you'll no longer swing and sway,"Divinely down the scented shade, Where feet to Ambulation","fade, And moons are lost in endless Day."
How shall we wind these,"wreaths of ours, Where there are",neither heads nor flowers?
"-- but we'll be missing The palms, and sunlight,","and the south; And there's an end, I think, of kissing,",When our mouths are one with Mouth.
"'Tau here',","Mamua, Crown the","hair, and come away!"
Hear the calling of the,"moon, And the whispering scents that stray About",the idle warm lagoon.
"Hasten, hand in human hand, Down the dark, the flowered","way, Along the whiteness of the sand, And in the water's soft caress, Wash the","mind of foolishness, Mamua, until the day."
Spend the glittering moonlight there,Pursuing down the soundless deep Limbs that gleam and,"shadowy hair, Or floating lazy, half-asleep."
"Dive and double and follow after, Snare in flowers,","and kiss, and call, With lips that fade, and human laughter And faces","individual, Well this side of Paradise!"
There's little,comfort in,the wise.
"Love, in you, went passing by, Penetrative,","remote, and rare, Like a bird in the wide air, And, as the bird,",it left no trace In the heaven of your face.
In your stupidity,I found The sweet hush after,a sweet sound.
All about you was the light That dims the greying end,"of night; Desire was the unrisen sun, Joy the day not yet begun, With","tree whispering to tree, Without wind, quietly."
"Wisdom slept within your hair, And Long-Suffering","was there, And, in the flowing of your dress,",Undiscerning Tenderness.

"The full, clear moon uprose and spread Her","cold, pale splendor o'er the sea; A light-strewn path that seemed to",lead Outward into eternity.
Between the darkness and the gleam An,old-world spell encompassed me: Methought that in a godlike,dream I trod upon the sea.
"What would'st thou have for easement after grief, When","the rude world hath used thee with despite, And care sits at thine elbow","day and night, Filching thy pleasures like a subtle thief?"
On such a day the shrunken stream Spends,its last water and runs dry; Clouds like far turrets in a,dream Stand baseless in the burning sky.
On such a day at every rod,"The toilers in the hay-field halt, With dripping brows, and",the parched sod Yields to the crushing foot like salt.
I watch the swinging currents go Far,"down to where, enclosed and piled, The logs crowd, and the Gatineau",Comes rushing from the northern wild.
"I see the long low point, where close The shore-lines,","and the waters end, I watch the barges pass in rows",That vanish at the tapering bend.
"I see no more the barges pass, Nor","mark the ripple round the pier, And all the uproar, mass","on mass, Falls dead upon a vacant ear."
"Beyond the tumult of the mills, And all","the city's sound and strife, Beyond the waste, beyond the","hills, I look far out and dream of life."
"Around the long low shanties, whose rough lines Break","the sealed dreams of many an unnamed lake, Already in the frost-clear",morns awake The crash and thunder of the falling pines.
"With what doubting eyes, oh sparrow,","Thou regardest me, Underneath yon spray of","yarrow, Dipping cautiously."
"Fear me not, oh little sparrow,","Bathe and never fear, For to me both pool and",yarrow And thyself are dear.
And on beside,the river's sober edge A long,fresh field lies black.
"Beyond, Low thickets gray and reddish stand,","Stroked white with birch; and near at hand, Over a little steel-smooth pond,",Hang multitudes of thin and withering sedge.
Across a waste and solitary rise A,"ploughman urges his dull team, A stooped gray figure with prone brow That","plunges bending to the plough With strong, uneven steps."
The stream Rings and,re-echoes with his,furious cries.
"Sometimes the lowing of a cow,","long-drawn, Comes from far off; and crows in strings Pass",on the upper silences.
"A flock of small gray goldfinches,","Flown down with silvery twitterings, Rustle",among the birch-cones and are gone.
"It was a bleak and sandy spot, And, all","about, the vacant plot Was peopled and inhabited",By scores of mulleins long since dead.
There was no sound,about the wood Save,the wind's secret stir.
I stood Among the mullein-stalks as still,As if myself had grown to be One of their sombre,"company, A body without wish or will."
"Now overhead, Where the rivulet loiters and","stops, The bittersweet hangs from the tops Of the alders and cherries","Its bunches of beautiful berries, Orange and red."
"And the snowbirds flee, Tossing up on the far","brown field, Now flashing and now concealed, Like fringes of spray That",vanish and gleam on the gray Field of the sea.
"Flickering light, Come the last of the leaves","down borne, And patches of pale white corn In the wind complain, Like",the slow rustle of rain Noticed by night.
"Withered and thinned, The sentinel mullein looms,",With the pale gray shadowy plumes Of the goldenrod; And the,"milkweed opens its pod, Tempting the wind."
"Aloft on the hill, A cloudrift opens and","shines Through a break in its gorget of pines, And it dreams at my feet","In a sad, silvery sheet, Utterly still."
"All things that be Seem plunged into silence, distraught,","By some stern, some necessitous thought: It wraps and enthralls Marsh,","meadow, and forest; and falls Also on me."
Along the narrow sandy height I watch them swiftly,"come and go, Or round the leafless wood, Like flurries of wind-driven snow, Revolving in","perpetual flight, A changing multitude."
"White are the far-off plains, and white The fading forests grow;","The wind dies out along the height, And denser still the snow, A gathering","weight on roof and tree, Falls down scarce audibly."
"The road before me smooths and fills Apace, and all","about The fences dwindle, and the hills Are blotted slowly out; The",naked trees loom spectrally Into the dim white sky.
The meadows and far-sheeted streams Lie still without a sound;,Like some soft minister of dreams The snow-fall hoods me round; In wood and,"water, earth and air, A silence everywhere."
"The evening deepens, and the gray Folds closer earth","and sky; The world seems shrouded far away; Its noises sleep, and I, As","secret as yon buried stream, Plod dumbly on, and dream."
"From this windy bridge at rest, In some former","curious hour, We have watched the city's hue, All along the orange west, Cupola","and pointed tower, Darken into solid blue."
"Subtly conscious, all awake, Let","us clear our eyes, and break Through the cloudy","chrysalis, See the wonder as it is."
"Creeping by the sullen wall, We forego the power to","see, The threads that bind us to the All, God or the Immensity; Whereof",on the eternal road Man is but a passing mode.
"Up the fielded slopes at morn, Where","light wefts of shadow pass, Films upon the bending","corn, I shall sweep the purple grass."
"Sun-crowned heights and mossy woods, And","the outer solitudes, Mountain-valleys, dim with","pine, Shall be home and haunt of mine."
"I shall search in crannied hollows, Where the sunlight scarcely","follows, And the secret forest brook Murmurs, and from nook to nook Forever","downward curls and cools, Frothing in the bouldered pools."
I shall stray by,"many a stream, Where",the half-shut lilies gleam.
Napping out the sultry days In the quiet,"secluded bays; Where the tasseled rushes tower,",O'er the purple pickerel-flower.
I shall hear the grasshoppers,"From the parched grass rehearse, And with drowsy note prolong",Evermore the same thin song.
I shall hear the crickets tell Stories by the humming,"well, And mark the locust, with quaint eyes, Caper in his cloak of gray Like",a jester in disguise Rattling by the dusty way.
"I shall dream by upland fences, Where the season's wealth","condenses Over many a weedy wreck, Wild, uncared-for, desert places, That sovereign","Beauty loves to deck With her softest, dearest graces."
There the long year dreams,"in quiet, And the summer's",strength runs riot.
Shall I not remember,"these, Deep in winter",reveries?
It holds,me,fast.
"A drifting, April, twilight sky, A wind which","blew the puddles dry, And slapped the river into waves That ran",and hid among the staves Of an old wharf.
A watery light Touched bleak the granite,"bridge, and white Without the slightest tinge of gold,",The city shivered in the cold.
All day my thoughts,"had lain as dead, Unborn and",bursting in my head.
From time to time I wrote,a word Which lines and circles,overscored.
My table seemed a,"graveyard, full Of coffins waiting",burial.
"I seized these vile abortions, tore","Them into jagged bits, and swore To be",the dupe of hope no more.
Into the evening,"straight I went, Starved of a",day's accomplishment.
"Unnoticing, I wandered where The city gave a","space for air, And on the bridge's parapet I leant, while","pallidly there set A dim, discouraged, worn-out sun."
"Behind me, where the tramways run,","Blossomed bright lights, I turned to leave, When",someone plucked me by the sleeve.
"""Your pardon, Sir, but I should",be Most grateful could you lend to me A,"carfare, I have lost my purse."
""" The voice","was clear, concise,",and terse.
I turned and met,the quiet gaze Of strange,eyes flashing through the haze.
"Like some Spanish don, Conferring","favours even when Asking an alms, he",bowed again And waited.
"But my pockets proved Empty,","in vain I poked and shoved, No hidden penny",lurking there Greeted my search.
"""Sir, I declare I have","no money, pray forgive, But let me",take you where you live.
""" And so we plodded",through the mire Where street lamps,cast a wavering fire.
I took no note of where we,"went, His talk became the element Wherein","my being swam, content."
It flashed like rapiers in the night,"Lit by uncertain candle-light, When on some moon-forsaken",sward A quarrel dies upon a sword.
"It hacked and carved like a cutlass blade, And the",noise in the air the broad words made Was the cry of the wind at a,window-pane On an Autumn night of sobbing rain.
I walked as though some,opiate Had stung and dulled my,"brain, a state Acute and slumbrous."
"We stopped, a","house stood silent,",dark.
"From the chimney, red","eyes sparked the gloom, And a cricket's",chirp filled all the room.
My host threw pine-cones on the fire,And crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre Wrapped,in the golden flame's desire.
"The chamber opened like an eye, As a","half-melted cloud in a Summer sky The soul of the house stood guessed,",and shy It peered at the stranger warily.
A little shop with,its various ware Spread on,shelves with nicest care.
"Pitchers, and jars, and jugs, and pots, Pipkins,","and mugs, and many lots Of lacquered canisters, black and","gold, Like those in which Chinese tea is sold."
"Chests, and puncheons,","kegs, and flasks, Goblets, chalices,","firkins, and casks."
In a corner three ancient,"amphorae leaned Against the wall,",like ships careened.
There was dusky blue of Wedgewood,"ware, The carved, white figures fluttering there Like",leaves adrift upon the air.
"Classic in touch, but","emasculate, The Greek soul",grown effeminate.
"Eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt, Hand on heart, and","daintily spelt Their love in flowers, brittle and bright, Artificial","and fragile, which told aright The vows of an eighteenth-century knight."
The cruder tones of old Dutch jugs Glared,"from one shelf, where Toby mugs Endlessly drank the foaming ale,","Its froth grown dusty, awaiting sale."
"""Ah, I see,""","Said I, ""you deal",in pottery.
""" The old man",turned and looked,at me.
Shook his,head,gently.
Then from under his cloak he took the,thing Which I had wondered to see him bring Guarded,so carefully from sight.
"The old man smiled, ""It has no sheath, 'Twas a little","careless to have it beneath My cloak, for a jostle to my",arm Would have resulted in serious harm.
"But it was so fine,","I could not wait, So I brought it",with me despite its state.
""" ""An amateur of","arms,"" I thought, ""Bringing home a",prize which he has bought.
""" ""You care",for this sort,"of thing, Dear Sir?"
""" ""Not in",the way which you,infer.
I need,"them in business,",that is all.
""" And he",pointed his finger,at the wall.
Then I saw,what I had not,noticed before.
The walls were hung with at least five,score Of swords and daggers of every size Which,nations of militant men could devise.
"Poisoned spears from tropic seas, That","natives, under banana trees, Smear with",the juice of some deadly snake.
"Blood-dipped arrows, which savages","make And tip with feathers, orange and green, A","quivering death, in harlequin sheen."
"High up, a fan of",glancing steel Was formed of,claymores in a wheel.
Jewelled swords worn at kings' levees Were suspended,"next midshipmen's dirks, and these Elbowed stilettos come from Spain,",Chased with some splendid Hidalgo's name.
Foils with buttons broken or,"lost Lay heaped on a chair, among them tossed",The boarding-pike of a privateer.
Against the chimney leaned,"a queer Two-handed weapon, with edges dull As",though from hacking on a skull.
The rusted,blood corroded,it still.
My host took up a paper,"spill From a heap which lay in an earthen bowl, And lighted",it at a burning coal.
"At either end of the table,","tall Wax candles were placed, each in a small, And slim,",and burnished candlestick Of pewter.
"The old man lit each wick, And the room leapt","more obviously Upon my mind, and I could see",What the flickering fire had hid from me.
"My head grew dizzy, I seemed to hear A battle-cry","from somewhere near, The clash of arms, and the squeal of balls, And",the echoless thud when a dead man falls.
"A smoky cloud had veiled the room, Shot",through with lurid glares; the gloom Pounded with shouts and dying,"groans, With the drip of blood on cold, hard stones."
Sabres and lances in streaks of light Gleamed,"through the smoke, and at my right A creese, like a licking serpent's","tongue, Glittered an instant, while it stung."
"Streams, and","points, and lines of",fire!
"The livid steel, which man's","desire Had forged and welded,",burned white and cold.
"Nerveless and shaking, round and round, I stared at","the walls and at the ground, Till the room spun like a whipping","top, And a stern voice in my ear said, ""Stop!"
I sell,no tools for,murderers here.
Of what,are you,thinking!
Please clear Your,mind of such,imaginings.
I will,tell you,of these things.
""" He pushed me into a great chair Of russet","leather, poked a flare Of tumbling flame, with the old","long sword, Up the chimney; but said no word."
Slowly he walked to,"a distant shelf, And brought back a",crock of finest delf.
He rested a moment a blue-veined,"hand Upon the cover, then cut a band Of paper,","pasted neatly round, Opened and poured."
A sliding sound Came from beneath,"his old white hands, And I saw a little","heap of sands, Black and smooth."
What could they,"be: ""Pepper,""",I thought.
He looked,at,me.
"""What you",see is poppy,seed.
Lethean,dreams for those in,need.
""" He took up the grains",with a gentle hand And sifted,them slowly like hour-glass sand.
On his old white finger,the almandine Shot out its,"rays, incarnadine."
"""Visions",for those too tired,to sleep.
These seeds cast,a film over,eyes which weep.
No single soul,"in the world could dwell, Without",these poppy-seeds I sell.
""" For a moment he","played with the shining stuff, Passing",it through his fingers.
"Enough At last, he poured it back","into The china jar of Holland blue, Which",he carefully carried to its place.
"Then, with a smile on his aged","face, He drew up a chair to the open",space 'Twixt table and chimney.
"""Without preface, Young man,",I will say that what you see Is not the puzzle,you take it to be.
""" ""But surely, Sir, there is something",strange In a shop with goods at so wide a range Each,"from the other, as swords and seeds."
Your neighbours must,have greatly differing,needs.
""" ""My neighbours,"" he said, and he","stroked his chin, ""Live everywhere",from here to Pekin.
"But you are wrong, my sort",of goods Is but one thing,in all its moods.
""" He took a shagreen letter","case From his pocket, and with charming grace Offered",me a printed card.

"I stared at the letters,","whimsical Indeed, or was",it merely a jest.
He answered my unasked request:,"""All books are either dreams or swords, You can","cut, or you can drug, with words."
My firm is a very ancient,"house, The entries on my books would rouse Your wonder,",perhaps incredulity.
I inherited from an ancestry Stretching remotely,"back and far, This business, and my clients are As were those of my grandfather's","days, Writers of books, and poems, and plays."
My swords are tempered for every,"speech, For fencing wit, or to carve a breach Through",old abuses the world condones.
These are purchased by men who feel The,"need of stabbing society's heel, Which egotism has",brought them to think Is set on their necks.
I have foils to pink An adversary,"to quaint reply, And I have customers who buy Scalpels",with which to dissect the brains And hearts of men.
Ultramundanes Even,demand some finer kinds To open,their own souls and minds.
But the other,half of my business deals With,visions and fancies.
"Under seals, Sorted,","and placed in vessels here, I keep the seeds",of an atmosphere.
Each jar contains,a different kind Of,poppy seed.
"From farthest Ind Come the purple flowers,","opium filled, From which the weirdest myths are distilled; My",orient porcelains contain them all.
Every castle of the air Sleeps in the,"fine black grains, and there Are seeds for every romance,",or light Whiff of a dream for a summer night.
I supply to,every want,and taste.
""" 'Twas slowly said, in no","great haste He seemed to push his wares,",but I Dumfounded listened.
By and by,A log on the,fire broke in two.

""" I groped for something",I should say; Amazement,held me numb.
"""To-day You sweated",at a fruitless,task.

""" Fatigue, excitement",of the past Few hours broke me,down at last.
All day I had,"forgot to eat, My nerves betrayed","me, lacking meat."
I bowed my head and,felt the storm Plough shattering,through my prostrate form.
The,tearless sobs,tore at my heart.
My host withdrew himself apart;,"Busied among his crockery, He paid",no farther heed to me.
"Exhausted, spent, I","huddled there, Within the arms",of the old carved chair.

""" He slowly walked to the window,","flung It open, and in the grey air rung The",sound of distant matin bells.

"""Nay, do not talk,"" He","urged me, ""you have a long",walk Before you.
""" And gently sped upon my way I stumbled","out in the morning hush, As down the empty street a flush",Ran level from the rising sun.
Another,day was just,begun.
"Over the housetops, Above the rotating chimney-pots,","I have seen a shiver of amethyst, And blue and cinnamon have flickered","A moment, At the far end of a dusty street."
Through sheeted rain Has come a lustre,"of crimson, And I have watched moonbeams Hushed by",a film of palest green.
It was,"her wings,",Goddess!
"Who stepped over the clouds, And",laid her rainbow feathers Aslant on,the currents of the air.
I followed her for,"long, With gazing eyes and",stumbling feet.
"I followed,",And watched for the flashing,of her wings.
In the city,"I found her, The narrow-streeted",city.
In the market-place I,"came upon her, Bound",and trembling.
Her fluted wings were fastened to,"her sides with cords, She was naked and cold, For that",day the wind blew Without sunshine.
"Men chaffered for her, They bargained","in silver and gold, In copper, in wheat, And",called their bids across the market-place.
"The tall yellow hollyhocks stand,","Still and straight, With their round blossoms spread open,",In the quiet sunshine.
"And still is the old Roman wall, Rough","with jagged bits of flint, And jutting stones, Old and","cragged, Quite still in its antiquity."
"The pear-trees press their branches against it,","And feeling it warm and kindly, The little",pears ripen to yellow and red.
"They hang heavy,","bursting with juice, Against",the wall.
So,"old,",so still!
The sky,is,still.
The clouds make no sound As they,"slide away Beyond the Cathedral Tower,","To the river, And the sea."
It is,"very quiet, Very",sunny.
The myrtle flowers,"stretch themselves in the sunshine,",But make no sound.
The roses push their,"little tendrils up, And climb",higher and higher.
In spots,they have climbed,over the wall.
But they are very,"still, They do not",seem to move.
And the old wall carries them,"Without effort, and quietly Ripens",and shields the vines and blossoms.
A bird in a plane-tree Sings,"a few notes, Cadenced and perfect They",weave into the silence.
The Cathedral,"bell knocks, One, two, three, and again,",And then again.
"It is a quiet sound, Calling","to prayer, Hardly scattering the stillness, Only",making it close in more densely.
The gardener,picks ripe gooseberries For the,Dean's supper to-night.
"It is very quiet,",Very regulated,and mellow.
But the wall,"is old, It has known",many days.
It is a Roman,"wall, Left-over and",forgotten.
Beyond the Cathedral,Close Yelp and mutter the discontents of,"people not mellow, Not well-regulated."
"People who care more for bread than for beauty,","Who would break the tombs of saints, And give the painted windows",of churches To their children for toys.
People who,"say: ""They are dead,",we live!

It is,always the,dead who breed.
"Crush the ripe fruit, and cast it","aside, Yet its seeds shall fructify, And",trees rise where your huts were standing.

"They gnaw like rats, And",the foundations of the Cathedral,are honeycombed.
The Dean is in the Chapter House; He,is reading the architect's bill For the completed,restoration of the Cathedral.
"He will have ripe gooseberries for supper, And then he will walk","up and down the path By the wall, And admire the snapdragons and dahlias,",Thinking how quiet and peaceful The garden is.

"Spread on the roadway, With open-blown","jackets, Like black, soaring pinions, They swoop down","the hillside, The Cyclists."

"What charm is yours, you faded old-world","tapestries, Of outworn, childish mysteries, Vague",pageants woven on a web of dream!
"And we, pushing and fighting","in the turbid stream Of modern life, find solace",in your tarnished broideries.
"Old lichened halls, sun-shaded by huge","cedar-trees, The layered branches horizontal","stretched, like Japanese Dark-banded prints."
"Carven cathedrals, on a sky","Of faintest colour, where the gothic spires fly","And sway like masts, against a shifting breeze."
"Worm-eaten pages, clasped in","old brown vellum, shrunk From over-handling,",by some anxious monk.
"Or Virgin's Hours, bright with gold and graven","With flowers, and rare birds, and all the Saints of Heaven, And Noah's","ark stuck on Ararat, when all the world had sunk."
"They have watered the street, It shines in","the glare of lamps, Cold, white lamps, And lies Like a","slow-moving river, Barred with silver and black."
"Cabs go down it,","One, And then",another.
Between them I,hear the shuffling,of feet.
Tramps doze on,"the window-ledges, Night-walkers pass along",the sidewalks.
The city is squalid and,"sinister, With the silver-barred street in the","midst, Slow-moving, A river leading nowhere."
"Opposite my window,","The moon cuts, Clear and round,",Through the plum-coloured night.
She cannot,light the city;,It is too bright.
It has,"white lamps, And",glitters coldly.
I stand in,the window and watch,the moon.
She is thin and,"lustreless, But",I love her.
I know the,"moon, And this is an",alien city.
To Ezra Pound With much friendship and admiration,and some differences of opinion The Poet took his,walking-stick Of fine and polished ebony.
Set in the close-grained wood Were quaint,"devices; Patterns in ambers, And",in the clouded green of jades.
"The top was of smooth, yellow ivory,",And a tassel of tarnished gold Hung by a faded cord from,"a hole Pierced in the hard wood, Circled with silver."
For years the,Poet had wrought upon,this cane.
"His wealth had gone to enrich it, His","experiences to pattern it, His labour",to fashion and burnish it.
"To him it was perfect,","A work of art and a weapon, A",delight and a defence.
The Poet,took his walking-stick,And walked abroad.
Peace be,"with you,",Brother.
The Poet,came to a,meadow.
Sifted through the grass,"were daisies, Open-mouthed, wondering,",they gazed at the sun.
The Poet,struck them with his,cane.
"The little heads flew off, and","they lay Dying, open-mouthed and","wondering, On the hard ground."
They are not,"roses,"" said",the Poet.
The Poet,came to,a stream.
Purple and blue flags waded in,the water; In among them hopped the speckled frogs;,"The wind slid through them, rustling."
The Poet lifted his,"cane, And the iris heads fell",into the water.
They floated,"away, torn",and drowning.
"""Wretched flowers,""","said the Poet, ""They are",not roses.
It,is your,affair.
The Poet,came to a,garden.
"Dahlias ripened against a wall, Gillyflowers","stood up bravely for all their short stature, And a trumpet-vine covered",an arbour With the red and gold of its blossoms.
Red and gold,like the brass notes,of trumpets.
The Poet knocked off the stiff heads,"of the dahlias, And his cane lopped the",gillyflowers at the ground.
Then he,severed the trumpet-blossoms,from their stems.
"Red and gold they lay scattered,","Red and gold, as on a battle field; Red","and gold, prone and dying."
"""They were not","roses,"" said",the Poet.
But behind you,"is destruction,",and waste places.
The Poet came home,"at evening, And in the candle-light He",wiped and polished his cane.
The orange candle flame leaped,"in the yellow ambers, And made the jades",undulate like green pools.
It played along the,"bright ebony, And glowed in",the top of cream-coloured ivory.
But these things were,"dead, Only the candle-light made",them seem to move.
"""It is a pity","there were no roses,""",said the Poet.
He perches in,"the slime, inert, Bedaubed with",iridescent dirt.
The ground is here,and there bestud With lumps,of only part-burned coal.
Their sharp and glistening,edges cut His stiffened,fingers.
Through the smut,Gleam red the wounds which,will not shut.
Wet through and shivering,he kneels And digs the slippery coals; like,eels They slide about.
His force all,"spent, He counts his small",accomplishment.
A half-a-dozen clinker-coals Which,still have fire,in their souls.
And in his thought,there burns The topaz fire,of votive urns.
He sees it fling,"from hill to hill, And still consumed,",is burning still.
Higher and higher,"leaps the flame, The smoke an",ever-shifting frame.
He sees a Spanish,"Castle old, With silver steps",and paths of gold.
From myrtle bowers comes the plash Of,"fountains, and the emerald flash Of parrots in the","orange trees, Whose blossoms pasture humming bees."
He knows he feeds the urns whose smoke Bears,"visions, that his master-stroke Is out of dirt and misery",To light the fire of poesy.
"He sees the glory,",yet he knows That others cannot,see his shows.
"To them his smoke is sightless, black, His votive vessels","but a pack Of old discarded shards, his fire A peddler's; still","to him the pyre Is incensed, an enduring goal!"
He sighs,and grubs another,coal.
How should I sing when buffeting,"salt waves And stung with bitter surges, in","whose might I toss, a cockleshell?"
"No parting cloud reveals a watery star, My","cries are washed away upon the wind, My cramped and blistering hands can find","no spar, My eyes with hope o'erstrained, are growing blind."
But painted on the sky,"great visions burn, My voice, oblation",from a shattered urn!
"So up, and down, and forward, inch by","inch, He gains upon the shore, where poppies glow And",sandflies dance their little lives away.
When the stooping sky Leans down upon the,"hills And tenderly, as one who soothing stills An anguish,",gathers earth to lie Embraced and girdled.
Do the,sun-filled men Feel patience,then?
Be,patient with,you?
"When pain's iron bars Their rivets tighten, stern","To bend and break their victims; as they turn, Hopeless, there stand the",purple jars Of night to spill oblivion.
Do these,men Feel,patience then?
My sun,and,moon!
My,basketful,of flowers!
My money-bag,of shining,dreams!
"My hours, Windless","and still, of",afternoon!
You are my world,and I your,citizen.
What meaning,can have patience,then?
Be not angry with me that I bear Your,"colours everywhere, All through each crowded street, And meet The","wonder-light in every eye, As I go by."
"Each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze, Blinded","by rainbow haze, The stuff of happiness, No less, Which wraps",me in its glad-hued folds Of peacock golds.
Before my feet the,"dusty, rough-paved way Flushes",beneath its gray.
"My steps fall ringed with light,","So bright, It seems a myriad suns",are strown About the town.
Around me is the sound of steepled,"bells, And rich perfumed smells Hang like a wind-forgotten cloud, And shroud",Me from close contact with the world.
You blazon me,with jewelled,insignia.
A flaming,nebula Rims in,my life.
And yet You set,"The word upon me, unconfessed",To go unguessed.
I pray to be the tool which to your hand Long,"use has shaped and moulded till it be Apt for your need, and,","unconsideringly, You take it for its service."
I demand To be forgotten in the woven strand,"Which grows the multi-coloured tapestry Of your bright life, and through its tissues","lie A hidden, strong, sustaining, grey-toned band."
"I wish to dwell around your daylight dreams, The railing to","the stairway of the clouds, To guard your steps securely up, where streams A",faery moonshine washing pale the crowds Of pointed stars.
Remember not,"whereby You mount, protected,",to the far-flung sky.
Before me lies a mass of shapeless,"days, Unseparated atoms, and I must Sort",them apart and live them.
Sifted dust Covers,the formless,heap.
"Reprieves, delays,","There are none,",ever.
As a monk who prays The sliding beads,"asunder, so I thrust Each tasteless particle aside, and",just Begin again the task which never stays.
And I have known a glory,"of great suns, When days flashed by, pulsing",with joy and fire!
Drunk bubbled wine in goblets,"of desire, And felt the whipped",blood laughing as it runs!
"Spilt is that liquor, my too","hasty hand Threw down the cup, and",did not understand.
"Dearest, forgive that",with my clumsy touch I,broke and bruised your rose.
I hardly could suppose It,were a thing so fragile that my,"clutch Could kill it, thus."
"It stood so proudly up upon its stem, I knew","no thought of fear, And coming very near Fell, overbalanced,","to your garment's hem, Tearing it down."
"Now, stooping, I upgather,","one by one, The crimson petals, all Outspread",about my fall.
They hold their,"fragrance still, a blood-red cone Of",memory.
And with my words I carve a little jar To,"keep their scented dust, Which, opening, you must Breathe to your soul,","and, breathing, know me far More grieved than you."
An arid daylight shines along the beach Dried to a grey,"monotony of tone, And stranded jelly-fish melt soft upon The sun-baked pebbles,","far beyond their reach Sparkles a wet, reviving sea."
"Here bleach The skeletons of fishes, every","bone Polished and stark, like traceries of stone, The joints",and knuckles hardened each to each.
And they are dead while,"waiting for the sea, The moon-pursuing","sea, to come again."
Their hearts are,blown away on the,hot breeze.
Only the,shells and stones can wait,to be Washed bright.
"For living things, who","suffer pain, May not endure",till time can bring them ease.
"Happiness, to","some, elation; Is, to others,",mere stagnation.
Days of passive,"somnolence, At its wildest,",indolence.
Hours of empty,"quietness, No delight, and",no distress.
Happiness to me,"is wine, Effervescent,",superfine.
Full of tang and fiery,"pleasure, Far too hot to leave me leisure For",a single thought beyond it.
This the bond:  it,Means to give one's soul to,gain Life's quintessence.
Even pain Pricks to livelier,"living, then Wakes the nerves to laugh again, Rapture's",self is three parts sorrow.
Although we must die,"to-morrow, Losing every thought but this;","Torn, triumphant, drowned in bliss."
Happiness:, We rarely,feel it.
How long shall I tarnish,"the mirror of life, A spatter of",rust on its polished steel!
The seasons reel,Like a goaded,wheel.
"Half-numb,","half-maddened, my days",are strife.
The night is sliding,"towards the dawn, And upturned",hills crouch at autumn's knees.
A torn moon flees Through,"the hemlock trees, The hours",have gnawed it to feed their spawn.
Pursuing and jeering,the misshapen thing A rabble,of clouds flares out of the east.
Like dogs unleashed After,"a beast, They stream on the sky,",an outflung string.
"A desolate wind, through the unpeopled dark, Shakes the","bushes and whistles through empty nests, And the fierce unrests I keep","as guests Crowd my brain with corpses, pallid and stark."
"Leave me in peace, O Spectres,","who haunt My labouring mind, I",have fought and failed.
"I have not quailed,",I was all unmailed And naked I,"strove, 'tis my only vaunt."
The moon drops into,the silver day As waking,out of her swoon she comes.
I hear the drums Of,millenniums Beating the mornings,I still must stay.
"The years I must watch go in and out, While I build","with water, and dig in air, And the trumpets blare Hollow despair,",The shuddering trumpets of utter rout.
An atom tossed in,a chaos made Of yeasting,"worlds, which bubble and foam."
Whence,have,I come?
What would,be,home?
I,hear no,answer.
I crave,to be lost like,a wind-blown flame.
"Pushed into nothingness by a breath, And",quench in a wreath Of engulfing death This fight,"for a God, or this devil's game."
There once was a man,"whom the gods didn't love, And a",disagreeable man was he.
"He loathed his neighbours, and his","neighbours hated him, And he",cursed eternally.
"He damned the sun, and","he damned the stars, And he blasted",the winds in the sky.
He sent to Hell every,"green, growing thing, And he raved at",the birds as they fly.
"His oaths were many, and his range was wide,",He swore in fancy ways; But his meaning was plain:  that no,created thing Was other than a hurt to his gaze.
"He dwelt all alone, underneath a leaning","hill, And windows toward the hill there were none, And on the other","side they were white-washed thick, To keep out every spark of the sun."
When he went to market he,walked all the way Blaspheming,at the path he trod.
He cursed at those he bought,"of, and swore at those he sold to, By all",the names he knew of God.
For his heart was soured in,"his weary old hide, And his hopes",had curdled in his breast.
"His friend had been untrue,",and his love had thrown him over For the,chinking money-bags she liked best.
The rats had devoured the contents of,"his grain-bin, The deer had trampled on his corn, His brook had shrivelled in","a summer drought, And his sheep had died unshorn."
"His hens wouldn't lay, and","his cow broke loose, And his old horse perished",of a colic.
In the loft his wheat-bags were,"nibbled into holes By little,",glutton mice on a frolic.
So he slowly lost,"all he ever had, And the blood",in his body dried.
Shrunken and mean he,"still lived on, And cursed that future",which had lied.
"So he dug, and he","delved, with care and pain, And the veins in",his forehead stood taut.
"At the end of an hour,","when every bone cracked, He",gathered up what he had sought.
A dim old vase of,"crusted glass, Prismed while it",lay buried deep.
"Shifting reds and greens, like","a pigeon's neck, At the touch of",the sun began to leap.
"It was dull in the tree-shade, but glowing in the light;","Flashing like an opal-stone, Carved into a flagon; and the colours","glanced and ran, Where at first there had seemed to be none."
It had handles on,"each side to bear it up, And a belly",for the gurgling wine.
"Its neck was slender,","and its mouth was wide, And its",lip was curled and fine.
"Then he carried it home, and","put it on a shelf, But it was",only grey in the gloom.
"So he fetched a pail,","and a bit of cloth, And he",went outside with a broom.
"The old man forgot to swear,",Watching its shadow grown a mammoth,"size, Dancing in the kitchen there."
He forgot to revile,the sun next morning When he found his,vase afire in its light.
And he carried it out,"of the house that day, And kept it",close beside him until night.
And so it,happened from day,to day.
The old man fed his,"life On the beauty of his vase,",on its perfect shape.
And his soul,forgot its former,strife.
And the village-folk came,and begged to see The flagon which,was dug from the ground.
And the old man never,"thought of an oath, in his joy At",showing what he had found.
One day the master of the village,"school Passed him as he stooped at toil, Hoeing for a bean-row, and at","his side Was the vase, on the turned-up soil."
"""My friend,"" said the schoolmaster, pompous and","kind, ""That's a valuable thing you have there, But it might get broken","out of doors, It should meet with the utmost care."
What are you,doing with,it out here?
""" ""Why, Sir,"" said the poor","old man, ""I like to have it","about, do you see?"
To be with,it all,I can.
""" ""You will smash it,"" said","the schoolmaster, sternly right,","""Mark my words and see!"
""" And he walked away,",while the old man looked At his treasure,despondingly.
Then he,"smiled to himself, for",it was his!
He had,"toiled for it,",and now he cared.
"loved its shape, and","its subtle, swift hues, Which his",own hard work had bared.
He would carry it,"round with him everywhere, As",it gave him joy to do.
A fragile,vase should not stand in,a bean-row!
Who would dare,to say,so?
"Then his heart was rested,","and his fears gave way, And he bent",to his hoe again.
"A clod rolled down, and","his foot slipped back, And he lurched",with a cry of pain.
For the blade of the hoe crashed,"into glass, And the vase fell to",iridescent sherds.
The old,"man's body heaved with slow,",dry sobs.
He did,"not curse, he had",no words.
"He gathered the fragments,","one by one, And his fingers",were cut and torn.
Then he made a hole,in the very place Whence the,beautiful vase had been borne.
"He covered the hole, and he","patted it down, Then he hobbled to",his house and shut the door.
He tore up his coat and,nailed it at the windows That no,beam of light should cross the floor.
He sat down in front,"of the empty hearth, And he",neither ate nor drank.
In three days they found,"him, dead and cold, And they said:"," ""What a queer old crank!"
""" Have","at you, you",Devils!
"My back's to this tree, For",you're nothing so nice That the hind-side of,me Would escape your assault.
Come,"on now,",all three!
"Here's a dandified gentleman,","Rapier at point, And a wrist which whirls",round Like a circular joint.
That's just to,anoint And make supple,your limbs.
'Tis a pity,the silk Of your waistcoat,is stained.
Your heart's full of,"milk, And so full,",it spills over!
I'm,not of,your ilk.
"You said so, and laughed At","my old-fashioned hose, At the cut of my hair,",At the length of my nose.
To carve it,to pattern I,think you propose.
"Your pardon, young Sir, But",my nose and my sword Are proving themselves,In quite perfect accord.
I grieve to,have spotted,Your shirt.
That blade's not a stick To slash,"right and left, And my skull is too thick To",be cleft with such cuffs Of a sword.
Now a,lick Down the side,of your face.
What a,"pretty, red",line!
Tell the taverns,that scar Was an,honour.
Don't whine That,a stranger,has marked you.
The,"tree's there, You",Swine!
Did you think to get in,"At the back, while your friends Made a little",diversion In front?
"So it ends, With",your sword clattering,down On the ground.
'Tis amends I make for your,"courteous Reception of me, A foreigner,",landed From over the sea.
Your welcome,was fervent I,think you'll agree.
"My shoes are not buckled With gold, nor my","hair Oiled and scented, my jacket's Not satin, I wear Corded","breeches, wide hats, And I make people stare!"
"So I do, but my heart Is the heart of","a man, And my thoughts cannot twirl In the limited span 'Twixt","my head and my heels, As some other men's can."
I have business more strange Than the shape of my,"boots, And my interests range From the sky, to the roots Of this","dung-hill you live in, You half-rotted shoots Of a mouldering tree!"
Here's,"at you,",once more.
You can show me the,"door, And jeer at my ways, But",you're pinked to the core.
"And before I have done, I will","prick my name in With the front of my steel, And your lily-white",skin Shall be printed with me.
For,I've come here,to win!
"My cup is empty to-night,","Cold and dry are its sides, Chilled by the",wind from the open window.
Empty and,"void, it sparkles white",in the moonlight.
The room is filled with,the strange scent Of wistaria,blossoms.
They sway in the,moon's radiance And tap,against the wall.
But the cup of my,"heart is still, And cold,",and empty.
"When you come, it brims Red and trembling","with blood, Heart's blood for your drinking; To fill your mouth",with love And the bitter-sweet taste of a soul.
My words are little,jars For you to take and,put upon a shelf.
"Their shapes are quaint and beautiful,",And they have many pleasant colours and lustres,To recommend them.
Also the scent from them,fills the room With sweetness of,flowers and crushed grasses.
You glow in my heart,Like the flames of,uncounted candles.
"But when I go to warm my hands, My","clumsiness overturns the light, And then I stumble",Against the tables and chairs.
"Outside the long window, With","his head on the stone sill, The dog is","lying, Gazing at his Beloved."
His eyes are wet,"and urgent, And his body",is taut and shaking.
It is cold on the terrace; A pale,"wind licks along the stone slabs, But the dog gazes",through the glass And is content.
The Beloved,is writing a,letter.
Occasionally,"she speaks to the dog, But she is",thinking of her writing.
"Does she, too,",give her devotion to,one Not worthy?
Licking passions have bitten their arabesques,"into it, And the mark of them lies, in and out, Worm-like, With the beauty",of corroded copper patterning white steel.
My brain is curved like a,"scimitar, And sighs at its cutting",Like a sickle mowing grass.
But of what,use is all,this to me!
"I, who am",set to crack stones In a,country lane!
My heart is like a cleft,pomegranate Bleeding crimson seeds,And dripping them on the ground.
My heart gapes because,"it is ripe and over-full, And its",seeds are bursting from it.
But how is,this other than a,torment to me!
"I, who am shut","up, with broken crockery,",In a dark closet!
I have been temperate,"always, But I am like to be",very drunk With your coming.
There have been times I feared to walk down,"the street Lest I should reel with the wine of you, And",jerk against my neighbours As they go by.
"I will mix me a drink of stars,-- Large stars","with polychrome needles, Small stars jetting maroon","and crimson, Cool, quiet, green stars."
It will lap and scratch As I swallow,it down; And I shall feel it as a serpent of,"fire, Coiling and twisting in my belly."
The rain gullies the garden,paths And tinkles on the broad,sides of grass blades.
"A tree, at","the end of my arm,",is hazy with mist.
"Even so, I can see","that it has red berries, A scarlet fruit,",Filmed over with moisture.
"It seems as though the rain,","Dripping from it, Should be",tinged with colour.
"I desire the berries,","But, in the mist, I only scratch",my hand on the thorns.
"Probably,","too, they are",bitter.
Hold your apron wide That I may pour my,"gifts into it, So that scarcely shall your two arms",hinder them From falling to the ground.
I would pour them upon you And,"cover you, For greatly do I feel this need Of giving","you something, Even these poor things."
Dearest,of my,Heart!
When I go away,from you The world beats dead Like,a slackened drum.
I call out for you against,the jutted stars And shout into,the ridges of the wind.
"Streets coming fast, One after the other, Wedge","you away from me, And the lamps of the city prick my",eyes So that I can no longer see your face.
"Why should I leave you,",To wound myself upon the sharp,edges of the night?
Hold your soul,open for my,welcoming.
Let the quiet of your spirit bathe me With,"its clear and rippled coolness, That, loose-limbed and weary, I find rest, Outstretched","upon your peace, as on a bed of ivory."
Between us,leapt a gold and,scarlet flame.
Into the hollow,"of the cupped, arched blue Of",Heaven it rose.
Its flickering,tongues up-drew And vanished,in the sunshine.
How it came We,"guessed not, nor what thing could",be its name.
From each to each had,sprung those sparks which flew Together,into fire.
But we knew The,winds would slap and quench,it in their game.
And so we graved and fashioned,"marble blocks To treasure it, and placed",them round about.
With pillared porticos,"we wreathed the whole, And roofed",it with bright bronze.
Behind carved,locks Flowered the tall,and sheltered flame.
"Without, The baffled",winds thrust at a column's,bole.
Beneath this sod lie,the remains Of one who,died of growing pains.
You ask,me for a,sonnet.
"Ah, my Dear, Can",clocks tick back to yesterday,at noon?
Can cracked and fallen leaves,recall last June And leap up on,"the boughs, now stiff and sere?"
"Yes,",'tis,that!
"My shadow stretches forward,",and the ground Is dark in front because,the light's behind.
"It is grotesque, with such a funny","hat, In watching it and walking I have found More",than enough to occupy my mind.
I cannot,"turn, the light would",make me blind.
1 A yellow band of light upon the street,"Pours from an open door, and makes a wide Pathway of bright gold",across a sheet Of calm and liquid moonshine.
"From inside Come shouts and streams of laughter, and","a snatch Of song, soon drowned and lost again in mirth, The clip of tankards","on a table top, And stir of booted heels."
Against the patch Of candle-light,"a shadow falls, its girth Proclaims the host","himself, and master of his shop."
2 This is the tavern,"of one Hilverdink, Jan Hilverdink,",whose wines are much esteemed.
Within his cellar men can have to drink The rarest,"cordials old monks ever schemed To coax from pulpy grapes, and with nice art",Improve and spice their virgin juiciness.
"Here froths the amber beer of many a brew, Crowning",each pewter tankard with as smart A cap as ever in his wantonness,Winter set glittering on top of an old yew.
3 Tall candles stand upon the,"table, where Are twisted glasses, ruby-sparked","with wine, Clarets and ports."
Those topaz bumpers,"were Drained from slim, long-necked bottles",of the Rhine.
The centre of the board is piled,"with pipes, Slender and clean, the still unbaptized",clay Awaits its burning fate.
"Behind, the vault Stretches from dim to dark, a","groping way Bordered by casks and puncheons, whose brass stripes And","bands gleam dully still, beyond the gay tumult."
"4 ""For good",old Master,"Hilverdink, a toast!"
""" Clamoured",a youth with tassels,on his boots.
"""Bring out your oldest brandy","for a boast, From that small barrel in the","very roots Of your deep cellar, man."
Why,here is,Max!
"Welcome,","Max, you're scarcely",here in time.
We want to drink to old,"Jan's luck, and smoke His best tobacco",for a grand climax.
"Here, Jan, a paper, fragrant","as crushed thyme, We'll have the best to wish","you luck, or may we choke!"
""" 5 Max Breuck unclasped","his broadcloth cloak,",and sat.
"""Well thought","of, Franz; here's luck to Mynheer",Jan.
""" The host set down a jar;",then to a vat Lost in the distance,"of his cellar, ran."
Max took a pipe as graceful as the,"stem Of some long tulip, crammed it full, and drew The pungent",smoke deep to his grateful lung.
It curled all blue throughout,the cave and flew Into,the silver night.
At once there flung Into the crowded shop,"a boy, who cried to them: 6 ""Oh, sirs, is there some learned","lawyer here, Some advocate, or all-wise counsellor?"
My master sent me to inquire,"where Such men do mostly be, but every door","Was shut and barred, for late has grown the hour."
I pray you tell me where I,"may now find One versed in law, the",matter will not wait.
""" ""I am a lawyer,","boy,"" said Max, ""my mind Is not locked to","my business, though 'tis late."
I shall be glad,to serve what way is in,my power.
"7 Then once more, cloaked and ready, he set out,","Tripping the footsteps of the eager boy Along the dappled cobbles,",while the rout Within the tavern jeered at his employ.
"Through new-burst elm leaves filtered the white moon, Who peered and splashed","between the twinkling boughs, Flooded the open spaces, and took flight Before","tall, serried houses in platoon, Guarded by shadows."
Past the Custom House,They took their hurried way,in the Spring-scented night.
8 Before a,door which fronted a canal,The boy halted.
A dim,tree-shaded,spot.
The water lapped the stones in,"musical And rhythmic tappings, and a galliot Slumbered",at anchor with no light aboard.
The boy,"knocked twice, and steps",approached.
"A flame Winked through the keyhole, then a","key was turned, And through the open door Max went toward","Another door, whence sound of voices came."
He entered a,large room where,candelabra burned.
9 An aged man,in quilted dressing gown,Rose up to greet him.
"""Sir,"" said Max, ""you sent Your",messenger to seek throughout,the town A lawyer.
"I have small accomplishment,","But I am at your service, and my","name Is Max Breuck, Counsellor, at your command."
""" ""Mynheer,"" replied the","aged man, ""obliged Am I,",and count myself much privileged.
I am Cornelius,"Kurler, and my fame Is better known",on distant oceans than on land.
10 My ship has tasted,"water in strange seas, And bartered goods",at still uncharted isles.
She's oft coquetted with,"a tropic breeze, And sheered off",hurricanes with jaunty smiles.
""" ""Tush, Kurler,"" here broke in the","other man, ""Enough of poetry,",draw the deed and sign.
""" The old man seemed to","wizen at the voice, ""My good friend, Grootver,--""",he at once began.
"""No introductions, let","us have some wine, And business, now that",you at last have made your choice.
""" 11 A harsh and","disagreeable man he proved to be, This Grootver,",with no single kindly thought.
"Kurler explained,",his old hands nervously,Twisting his beard.
His vessel,he had bought From,Grootver.
12 Little by little,Max made out the way That Grootver,pressed that poor harassed old man.
"His money he must have,",too long delay Had turned the usurer,to a ruffian.
"13 Such light and foamy silks, like crinkled cream, And","indigo more blue than sun-whipped seas, Spices and fragrant trees, a massive beam Of","sandalwood, and pungent China teas, Tobacco, coffee!"
"""  Grootver",only,laughed.
"Max heard it all, and",worse than all he heard The deed to,which the sailor gave his word.
"He shivered, 'twas as if the villain","gaffed The old man with a boat-hook; bleeding, spent, He begged for",life nor knew at all the road he went.
14 For Kurler had,"a daughter, young and gay, Carefully reared","and shielded, rarely seen."
But on one black and most unfriendly,day Grootver had caught her as she passed between The,kitchen and the garden.
"She had run In fear of him, his evil","leering eye, And when he came she, bolted in her room,","Refused to show, though gave no reason why."
The spinning of her future,"had begun, On quiet nights she heard",the whirring of her doom.
15 Max mended an,"old goosequill by the fire, Loathing his","work, but seeing no thing to do."
He felt his hands were building,"up the pyre To burn two souls, and seized with",vertigo He staggered to his chair.
Before him lay White,paper still unspotted,by a crime.
"""Now, young man, write,""",said Grootver in,his ear.
"""`If in two years my vessel should yet","stay From Amsterdam, I give Grootver, sometime A","friend, my daughter for his lawful wife."
""" 16 And Kurler swore, a palsied,","tottering sound, And traced his name, a","shaking, wandering line."
Then dazed,"he sat there, speechless",from his wound.
Grootver got,"up:  ""Fair voyage,",the brigantine!
""" He shuffled","from the room, and left",the house.
His footsteps wore,to silence down,the street.
At last the,aged man began,to rouse.
With help he once,more gained his trembling,feet.
"""My daughter,","Mynheer Breuck, is friendless",now.
Will,you watch over,her?
I ask,a solemn,vow.
""" 17 Max laid his hand upon the old","man's arm, ""Before God, sir, I vow, when you are gone, So to protect",your daughter from all harm As one man may.
"""  Thus sorrowful, forlorn, The situation","to Max Breuck appeared, He gave his promise almost without","thought, Nor looked to see a difficulty."
"""Bred Gently to watch a mother left alone; Bound by","a dying father's wish, who feared The world's accustomed harshness when he should","be dead; 18 Such was my case from youth, Mynheer Kurler."
"Last Winter she died also, and my","days Are passed in work, lest I should grieve for her, And undo",habits used to earn her praise.
My leisure I will gladly,give to see Your household and your,daughter prosperous.
""" The sailor","said his thanks, but",turned away.
"He could not brook that his humility,","So little wonted, and so tremulous, Should first before",a stranger make such great display.
"19 ""Come here to-morrow as the bells","ring noon, I sail at the full sea, my daughter",then I will make known to you.
'Twill be a boon If after I have,"bid good-by, and when Her eyeballs scorch with watching","me depart, You bring her home again."
She lives with one,"Old serving-woman, who has",brought her up.
But that,is no friend for so free,a heart.
No head,to match her,questions.
It,is,done.
And I must,sail away to come,and brim her cup.
20 My ship's the fastest,"that owns Amsterdam As home, so not",a letter can you send.
"I shall be back, before",to where I am Another,ship could reach.
Now your,"stipend--"" Quickly Breuck",interposed.
"""When you once more",Tread on the stones which,pave our streets.
"To-morrow I will be,","at stroke of noon,",At the great wharf.
"""  Then hurrying, in spite Of cake",and wine the old man pressed upon Him ere he,"went, he took his leave and shut the door."
21 'Twas noon in,"Amsterdam, the day was clear, And sunshine",tipped the pointed roofs with gold.
The brown canals ran liquid,"bronze, for here The sun sank deep into",the waters cold.
And every clock,"and belfry in the town Hammered,","and struck, and rang."
"Such peals of bells, To shake the sunny morning","into life, And to proclaim the middle, and the","crown, Of this most sparkling daytime!"
"The crowd swells, Laughing",and pushing toward the quays in,friendly strife.
"22 The ""Horn","of Fortune"" sails away",to-day.
At highest tide,"she lets her anchor go, And",starts for China.
Giddy in freshest,"paint she curtseys low, And beckons to",her boats to let her start.
Blue is the,"ocean, with a flashing",breeze.
The shining,waves are quick to take,her part.
They,push and spatter,her.
"Her sails are loose, Her tackles","hanging, waiting men to seize And haul","them taut, with chanty-singing, as they choose."
23 At the great wharf's,"edge Mynheer Kurler stands, And by his side, his","daughter, young Christine."
"Max Breuck is there,","his hat held in his hands, Bowing",before them both.
The brigantine Bounces,"impatient at the long delay, Curvets","and jumps, a cable's length from shore."
A heavy galliot unloads on,"the walls Round, yellow cheeses, like gold cannon",balls Stacked on the stones in pyramids.
Once more Kurler has,"kissed Christine, and now",he is away.
24 Christine stood rigid like,"a frozen stone, Her hands wrung pale in",effort at control.
Max moved aside and,"let her be alone, For grief exacts each",penny of its toll.
The dancing,boat tossed on the glinting,sea.
A sun-path swallowed it in flaming,"light, Then, shrunk a cockleshell, it came again",Upon the other side.
Now on the,"lee It took the ""Horn","of Fortune""."
Straining sight Could see,"it hauled aboard, men pulling",on the crane.
25 Then up above the eager,"brigantine, Along her slender masts, the sails took","flight, Were sheeted home, and ropes were coiled."
The shine Of the wet,"anchor, when its heavy weight",Rose splashing to the deck.
"These things they saw, Christine","and Max, upon the",crowded quay.
"They saw the sails grow white, then blue in shade, The ship had","turned, caught in a windy flaw She glided imperceptibly away,",Drew farther off and in the bright sky seemed to fade.
"26 Home, through the emptying","streets, Max took Christine, Who would have hid",her sorrow from his gaze.
Before the iron,"gateway, clasped between Each garden","wall, he stopped."

""" 27 She straight","unhasped the tall, beflowered",gate.

At either end was set a wide Path,"strewn with fine, red gravel, and such shows Of tulips in",their splendour flaunted everywhere!
"28 From side to side, midway","each path, there ran A longer one which",cut the space in two.
Then the dame Katrina shook,"them down, in pelting showers They plunged to earth,",and died transformed to sugared food.
"29 Against the high, encircling","walls were grapes, Nailed close to feel the baking of",the sun From glowing bricks.
Their microscopic,shapes Half hidden by,serrated leaves.
And one Old cherry,tossed its branches,near the door.
"Bordered along the wall, in beds between,","Flickering, streaming, nodding in the air, The pride of all the garden,",there were more Tulips than Max had ever dreamed or seen.
They,"jostled, mobbed, and",danced.
Max stood,at helpless,stare.

"""  With girlish zest",To please her guest,she flew.
A moment more,"She came again, with her",old nurse behind.
"Then, sitting on the bench and knitting fast, She talked","as someone with a noble store Of hidden fancies, blown upon the","wind, Eager to flutter forth and leave their silent past."
31 The little apple,leaves above their heads Let fall a,quivering sunshine.
"Quiet,","cool, In blossomed",boughs they sat.
"Beyond, the beds Of tulips blazed,",a proper vestibule And antechamber,to the rainbow.
Dyes Of,prismed richness:, Carmine.
Blues Tinging,dark browns to,purple.
Silvers flushed,To amethyst,and tinct with gold.
Round eyes Of,"scarlet, spotting tender",saffron hues.
Violets sunk,"to blacks, and reds in",orange crushed.

"Nacreous,","iridescent,","mottled, checked."
"Some purest sulphur-yellow,",others made An ivory-white,with disks of copper flecked.
Sprinkled and,"striped, tasselled, or keenest",edged.

"They bloomed, and seemed strange wonder-moths","new-fledged, Born of the spectrum wedded",to a flame.

33 Her knitting-needles clicked and,"Christine talked, This child matured to woman unaware,",The first time left alone.
Now dreams,once balked Found,utterance.
Max thought her,very,fair.
Beneath her cap,"her ornaments shone gold, And",purest gold they were.
Kurler,was rich,And heedful.
Her old maiden,aunt had died Whose darling,care she was.
"Now, growing","bold, She asked, had Max",a sister?
Dropped a stitch,At her own,candour.
Then she,paused and softly,sighed.
34 Two,years was,long!
She loved her,"father well, But fears",she had not.
He had always,been Just sailed or,sailing.
And she must not dwell On,"sad thoughts, he had told her so, and seen",Her smile at parting.
But,she sighed,once more.
Two years was,long; 'twas not one hour,yet!
Mynheer,Grootver she would not,see at all.
"Yes, yes, she knew, but ere","the date so set, The ""Horn of Fortune""",would be at the wall.
When Max had,"bid farewell, she",watched him from the door.
"Such things were Christine's world,","and his was she Winter drew near,",his sun was in her smiles.
"Another Spring, and","at his law he toiled, Unspoken hope",counselled a wise efficiency.
"36 Max Breuck was honour's soul,",he knew himself The guardian of,"this girl; no more, no less."
As one in charge of guineas on a shelf,"Loose in a china teapot, may confess His need, but may",not borrow till his friend Comes back to give.
"So Max, in honour, said No word",of love or marriage; but the days He,clipped off on his almanac.
The,end Must,come!
"The second year, with feet","of lead, Lagged slowly by till Spring",had plumped the willow sprays.
37 Two years had made Christine,"a woman grown, With dignity and",gently certain pride.
But all her childhood,"fancies had not flown, Her thoughts in lovely",dreamings seemed to glide.
Max was her trusted,"friend, did she confess A closer",happiness?
Max,could,not tell.
Two years were over,and his life he found Sphered,and complete.
In restless eagerness,"He waited for the ""Horn","of Fortune""."
Well Had he,"his promise kept, abating",not one pound.
38 Spring,slipped away to,Summer.
Still no,glass Sighted the,brigantine.
Then Grootver came,Demanding Jufvrouw,Kurler.
His trespass,"Was justified, for he had",won the game.
Christine,"begged time, more",time!
"Midsummer went,",And Grootver waxed,impatient.
Still,the ship,Tarried.
"Christine, betrayed","and weary, sank To",dreadful terrors.
"One day,","crazed, she sent",For Max.
"""Come quickly,"" said her","note, ""I skip The worst distress",until we meet.
The,world is,blank.
""" 39 Through the long",sunshine of late afternoon,Max went to her.
"In the pleached alley,","lost In bitter reverie,",he found her soon.
"And sitting down beside her,","at the cost Of all his secret, ""Dear,"" said he, ""what thing",So suddenly has happened?
"""  Then, in tears, She told that Grootver, on the","following morn, Would come to marry her, and shuddering:","""I will die rather, death has lesser fears."
""" Max felt the shackles",drop from the oath which,he had sworn.

"With dread, begot Of Grootver's","name, and silence, and the night,",She shook and trembled.
Words in moaning,plaint Wooed him to,stay.
"She feared,","she knew not why, Yet",greatly feared.
She seemed some,anguished saint Martyred,by visions.
Max Breuck soothed her fright,"With wisdom, then stepped out under",the cooling sky.
45 But at the gate once,more she held him close And quenched her heart,again upon his lips.
"""My Sweetheart,",why this,terror?
I propose,But to be gone one,hour!

"Softly he laughed,","""One hour through the",town By moonlight!

"Not a jot He feared this meeting,",nor the rancorous gall Grootver would,spit on him who marred his plot.

"A flare Of spotted green, and a",snake had gone Into the bed where the snowdrops shone,"In green new-started, Their white bells parted."
"Two by two, in a long","brown line, The nuns were walking to breathe",the fine Bright April air.
They must go in,soon And work at their tasks all,the afternoon.
But,this time,is theirs!
They walk,in,pairs.
"First comes the Abbess, preoccupied","And slow, as a woman often tried, With",her temper in bond.
Then the,oldest,nun.
"Then younger and younger,",until the last one Has a laugh on,"her lips, And fairly skips."
They wind about the,gravel walks And all the long,line buzzes and talks.
They step in time,"to the ringing bell, With scarcely",a shadow.
The sun is well In,the core of a sky,Domed silverly.

""" Sister Angelique",said she must get her spud And free the,earth round the jasmine roots.
Sister,Veronique said:," ""Oh, look at those shoots!"
There's a,"crocus up, With",a purple cup.
""" But Sister Clotilde said nothing","at all, She looked up and down the old grey wall To",see if a lizard were basking there.
She looked across the,garden to where A sycamore,Flanked the garden door.
"She was restless, although her little feet","danced, And quite unsatisfied, for it chanced Her morning's work",had hung in her mind And would not take form.
She could not find The,beautifulness For,the Virgin's dress.
Should it be,"of pink, or",damasked blue?
Or perhaps,lilac with gold,shotted through?
Should it be banded,"with yellow and white Roses,",or sparked like a frosty night?
Or a crimson,sheen Over some sort,of green?
But Clotilde's eyes saw nothing new In,"all the garden, no single hue So lovely or so",marvellous That its use would not seem impious.
So on she,"walked, And the others",talked.
Sister Elisabeth edged away From what her,"companion had to say, For Sister Marthe saw the world in little, She",weighed every grain and recorded each tittle.
She did plain,stitching And worked,in the kitchen.
"""Sister Radegonde","knows the apples won't last, I",told her so this Friday past.
I must speak,to her before,Compline.
""" Her words were like",dust motes in slanting,sunshine.
The other,"nun sighed, With her pleasure",quite dried.
Suddenly Sister,"Berthe cried out: ""The snowdrops",are blooming!
"""  They",turned,about.
The little white cups bent over the,"ground, And in among the light stems wound A crested","snake, With his eyes awake."
His crest was amber,"glittered with blue, And opaque",so the sun came shining through.
It seemed a,crown with,fiery points.
When he quivered all down,"his scaly joints, From every",slot The sparkles shot.
The nuns huddled,"tightly together, fear Catching",their senses.
But Clotilde must peer,"More closely at the beautiful snake,",She seemed entranced and eased.
Could she make,"Colours so rare,",The dress were there.
The Abbess,shook off her,lethargy.
"""Sisters,",we will walk,"on,"" said she."
Sidling away from the,"snowdrop bed, The line curved forwards,",the Abbess ahead.
Only Clotilde,Was the last to,yield.
When the recreation,hour was done Each went,in to her task.
"Alone In the library, with","its great north light, Clotilde wrought at an exquisite",Wreath of flowers For her Book of Hours.
They framed the,picture she had,"made, Half-delighted and half-afraid."
In a courtyard with a lozenged,"floor The Virgin watched, and through the arched door The angel",came Like a springing flame.
His wings were dipped in violet,"fire, His limbs were strung to",holy desire.
He lowered his head and,"passed under the arch, And the air",seemed beating a solemn march.
The Virgin waited,With eyes,dilated.
Her face was quiet,"and innocent, And beautiful",with her strange assent.
A silver thread,about her head Her halo,was poised.
But in the stead Of,"her gown, there remained The","vellum, unstained."
Clotilde painted the flowers,"patiently, Lingering over",each tint and dye.
"She could spend great pains,","now she had seen That curious,",unimagined green.
A colour,so strange It had seemed,to change.
She thought it,had altered while,she gazed.
At first it had been simple green; then glazed All,"over with twisting flames, each spot A molten colour, trembling","and hot, And every eye Seemed to liquefy."
She had made,"a plan, and her",spirits danced.
"After all, she had only glanced At that","wonderful snake, and she must know Just what hues made the creature",throw Those splashes and sprays Of prismed rays.
When evening prayers,"were sung and said, The nuns lit",their tapers and went to bed.
And soon in the convent there was no,"light, For the moon did not rise until late that night,",Only the shine Of the lamp at the shrine.
Clotilde lay,still in her trembling,sheets.
Her heart,shook her body,with its beats.
She could not see till the moon should,"rise, So she whispered prayers and kept her eyes",On the window-square Till light should be there.
The faintest shadow,of a branch Fell,on the floor.
"Clotilde, grown staunch With solemn","purpose, softly rose And fluttered down between",the rows Of sleeping nuns.
She,almost,runs.
She must go out through the little,side door Lest the nuns who were always praying before,The Virgin's altar should hear her pass.
"She pushed the bolts, and",over the grass The red moon's,brim Mounted its rim.
Her shadow crept up the convent wall As,"she swiftly left it, over all The garden lay the level glow Of","a moon coming up, very big and slow."
The,gravel,glistened.
She stopped,and,listened.
"It was still, and",the moonlight was,getting clearer.
"She laughed a little,",but she felt queerer Than ever,before.
The snowdrop bed,Was reached and she bent,down her head.
On the striped,ground The snake,was wound.
For a moment Clotilde,"paused in alarm, Then she rolled up",her sleeve and stretched out her arm.
She thought she,"heard steps, she must",be quick.
She darted her hand,"out, and seized the thick Wriggling","slime, Only just in time."
The old gardener came muttering,"down the path, And his shadow fell like a broad, black swath,",And covered Clotilde and the angry snake.
"He bit her,",but what difference,did that make!
The Virgin,should dress In his,loveliness.
The gardener was covering,"his new-set plants For the night was chilly, and nothing daunts",Your lover of growing things.
He spied Something to do,"and turned aside, And the moonlight","streamed On Clotilde, and gleamed."
His business,finished the gardener,rose.
"He shook and swore, for the moonlight shows","A girl with a fire-tongued serpent, she Grasping him,","laughing, while quietly Her eyes are weeping."
Is,he,sleeping?
"He thinks it is some holy vision, Brushes that aside","and with decision Jumps--and hits the snake with his stick, Crushes his spine,","and then with quick, Urgent command Takes her hand."
The gardener sucks the poison,"and spits, Cursing and praying as befits A poor",old man half out of his wits.
"""Whatever possessed you, Sister,",it's Hatched of a devil And,very evil.
It's one of them,horrid basilisks,You read about.
They say a man risks,"His life to touch it, but I guess I've",sucked it Out by now.
Lucky I,chucked it Away,from you.
"He is dead now, but his","colours won't fade At once, and by noon I",shall have made The Virgin's robe.
"Oh, Francois, see",How kindly the moon shines,down on me!
I can't die,"yet, For the",task was set.
""" ""You won't die now, for I've","sucked it away,"" Grumbled old","Francois, ""so have your play."
If the Virgin is set on,"snake's colours so strong,--"" ""Francois, don't say","things like that, it is wrong."
""" So Clotilde",vented,Her creed.
"""He can't do","no more harm, Sister,""",said he.
"""Paint as",much as,you like.
"""  And gingerly",He picked up the snake,with his stick.
"Clotilde Thanked him, and begged that","he would shield Her secret, though itching",To talk in the kitchen.
At dawn's first,saffron-spired warning Clotilde,was up.
"And all that morning, Except when she went","to the chapel to pray, She painted, and when the April","day Was hot with sun, Clotilde had done."
"She drooped, though her heart beat loud At","the beauty before her, and her spirit bowed To the",Virgin her finely-touched thought had made.
"A lady,","in excellence arrayed,",And wonder-souled.
From long fasting Clotilde felt weary,"and faint, But her eyes were starred like those of a saint Enmeshed",in Heaven's beatitude.
A sudden clamour,hurled its rude Force to break,Her vision awake.
The door nearly leapt,"from its hinges, pushed By the",multitude of nuns.
"They hushed When they saw Clotilde,","in perfect quiet, Smiling, a little",perplexed at the riot.
And all,the hive Buzzed,"""She's alive!"
He had found the strain Of,"silence too great, and preferred the pain",Of a conscience outraged.
"The news had spread,",And all were convinced Clotilde,must be dead.
"For Francois, to","spite them, Had not seen",fit to right them.
How could we have,guessed Our convent,so blessed!
To,have,you die!
"And I, who am","A hollow, living shell, the",grave Is empty of me.
"Holy Mary, I","crave To be taken, Dear Mother, Instead",of this other.
""" She dropped on her knees and","silently prayed, With anguished hands and",tears delayed To a painful slowness.
The minutes,drew To,fractions.
Then the west wind,"blew The sound of a bell, On",a gusty swell.
It came skipping over the slates of,"the roof, And the bright bell-notes seemed a reproof To","grief, in the eye of so fair a day."
"The Abbess,","comforted, ceased",to pray.
And the sun lit,the flowers In Clotilde's,Book of Hours.
It glistened the green of the Virgin's dress And,"made the red spots, in a flushed excess, Pulse and start; and the violet",wings Of the angel were colour which shines and sings.
The book seemed,a choir Of rainbow,fire.
"The Abbess crossed herself, and each nun Did","the same, then one by one, They filed to the chapel, that incensed prayers",Might plead for the life of this sister of theirs.
"Clotilde,",the,Inspired!
She only,felt,tired.
The old chronicles say,she did not die Until,heavy with years.
And that is why There hangs in the convent,"church a basket Of osiered silver, a holy casket,",And treasured therein A dried snake-skin.
Panels of claret,and blue which shine Under the,moon like lees of wine.
A coronet done in a golden,"scroll, And wheels which blunder and creak as they roll Through",the muddy ruts of a moorland track.
They,daren't,look back!
They are whipping,and cursing the,horses.
What brutes,men are when,they think they're scored.
They are scared,"half out of their wits,",poor souls.
For my lord has a casket,"full of rolls Of minted sovereigns,",and silver bars.
I laugh to,think how he'll show his scars,In London to-morrow.
He whines with,rage In his varnished,cage.
My lady,has shoved her rings over,her toes.
'Tis an ancient,trick every night-rider,knows.
"But I shall relieve her of them yet, When",I see she limps in the minuet I must beg to,"celebrate this night, And the green moonlight."
There's nothing to hurry,"about, the plain Is hours","long, and the mud's a strain."
My gelding's uncommonly,"strong in the loins, In half an",hour I'll bag the coins.
"'Tis a clear,",sweet night on the,turn of Spring.
The,chase is,the thing!
How the coach flashes,"and wobbles, the moon Dripping",down so quietly on it.
A tune Is beating out,"of the curses and screams, And the cracking",all through the painted seams.
"Steady, old","horse, we'll keep",it in sight.
'Tis,a rare fine,night!
There's a clump of trees on,"the dip of the down, And the sky shimmers",where it hangs over the town.
It seems a shame to break the air,"In two with this pistol, but I've my share",Of drudgery like other men.
"Hold up,","you beast, now",what the devil!
Confound this,"moor for a pockholed, evil,",Rotten marsh.
My,right,leg's snapped.
'Tis a mercy,"he's rolled, but I'm nicely",capped.
A broken-legged,man and a,broken-legged horse!
They'll,"get me, of",course.
The cursed coach will reach the town And,"they'll all come out, every loafer grown A",lion to handcuff a man that's down.
"Oh, the",coachman's bulleted,hat!
I'll give,it a head,to fit it pat.
_They handcuffed the body just,"for style, And they hung him in chains for the",volatile Wind to scour him flesh from bones.
Way out on the moor you,can hear the groans His gibbet makes,when it blows a gale.
'Tis a,common,tale.
"_ Paul Jannes was working very late, For",this watch must be done by eight To-morrow or the,Cardinal Would certainly be vexed.
"So they picked his pocket,",And he paid in jewels for his,slobbering kisses.
This watch was made to buy him blisses,"From an Austrian countess on her way Home,",and she meant to start next day.
"Paul worked by the pointed, tulip-flame Of a tallow","candle, and became So absorbed, that his old clock made him",wince Striking the hour a moment since.
"Its echo, only","half apprehended, Lingered",about the room.
"He ended Screwing the little rubies in,","Setting the wheels to lock and spin, Curling the infinitesimal","springs, Fixing the filigree hands."
Chippings Of,precious stones lay,strewn about.
The table before,him was a rout Of splashes,and sparks of coloured light.
There was yellow gold,"in sheets, and quite A heap of","emeralds, and steel."
Here was,"a gem, there was",a wheel.
And glasses lay like limpid lakes Shining and,"still, and there were flakes Of silver, and shavings of pearl, And little",wires all awhirl With the light of the candle.
He took the watch And wound its hands,"about to match The time, then glanced up to",take the hour From the hanging clock.
"Good,",Merciful,Power!
How came that shadow,"on the wall, No woman",was in the room!
His tall Chiffonier,stood gaunt behind,His chair.
His old,"cloak, rabbit-lined,",Hung from a peg.
The,door was,closed.
Just for a,moment he must,have dozed.
"He looked again,",and saw it,plain.
The silhouette made a blue-black stain On,"the opposite wall, and it never wavered Even when the",candle quavered Under his panting breath.
"What made That beautiful, dreadful thing, that","shade Of something so lovely, so exquisite, Cast from a substance which",the sight Had not been tutored to perceive?
Paul brushed,his eyes across,his sleeve.
"Clear-cut, the Shadow on","the wall Gleamed black, and never",moved at all.
"Paul's watches were like amulets, Wrought into","patterns and rosettes; The cases were all set with stones,","And wreathing lines, and shining zones."
"He knew the beauty in a curve, And",the Shadow tortured every nerve With its perfect,rhythm of outline Cutting the whitewashed wall.
So fine Was the neck he,knew he could have spanned It about with,the fingers of one hand.
The lady,was edged with the,stamp of race.
A,singular vision,in such a place.
He moved the candle to,the tall Chiffonier; the,Shadow stayed on the wall.
He threw his cloak upon,"a chair, And still the lady's",face was there.
From every corner,"of the room He saw, in the patch of","light, the gloom That was the lady."
Her violet bloom,Was almost brighter than that,which came From his candle's tulip-flame.
He set the filigree hands; he laid,The watch in the case which he had made; He put on his,"rabbit cloak, and snuffed His candle out."
The room seemed,stuffed With,darkness.
Softly he crossed,"the floor, And let himself",out through the door.
The sun was flashing,"from every pin And wheel,",when Paul let himself in.
The whitewashed,walls were hot,with light.
The room was the core of a,"chrysolite, Burning and shimmering",with fiery might.
The sun was so bright that,no shadow could fall From the furniture,upon the wall.
Paul sighed as he looked at,the empty space Where a glare,usurped the lady's place.
"He settled himself to his work, but his mind Wandered,","and he would wake to find His hand suspended, his eyes grown dim, And",nothing advanced beyond the rim Of his dreaming.
The Cardinal sent to,"pay For his watch, which had purchased",so fine a day.
But Paul could hardly,"touch the gold, It seemed the price","of his Shadow, sold."
With the first twilight he struck a,match And watched the little blue stars hatch Into,an egg of perfect flame.
"He lit his candle,",and almost in shame At his,"eagerness, lifted his eyes."
"The Shadow was there,",and its precise Outline etched,"the cold, white wall."
The young,"man swore, ""By",God!
"You, Paul, There's",something the matter,with your brain.
Go home now,and sleep off,the strain.
""" The next day was","a storm, the rain Whispered",and scratched at the window-pane.
A grey and,shadowless morning filled,The little shop.
"The watches,","chilled, Were dead and sparkless",as burnt-out coals.
The gems lay on the table,"like shoals Of stranded shells, their colours faded, Mere heaps","of stone, dull and degraded."
"Paul's head was heavy,","his hands obeyed No orders,",for his fancy strayed.
His work became a,simple round Of watches repaired,and watches wound.
The slanting ribbons of the,"rain Broke themselves on the window-pane, But Paul",saw the silver lines in vain.
In the morning,he selected all His,perfect jacinths.
"When, at dusk, the",Shadow grew Upon the,"wall, Paul's work was through."
"Holding the watch, he spoke to","her: ""Lady, Beautiful Shadow, stir",Into one brief sign of being.
"Turn your eyes this way, and seeing This watch, made from","those sweet curves Where your hair from your forehead swerves, Accept the gift",which I have wrought With your fairness in my thought.
"Grant me this, and",I shall be Honoured,overwhelmingly.
""" The Shadow rested","black and still, And the wind sighed",over the window-sill.
Topazes ran in a foamy,"stream Over the cover, the hands were studded With","garnets, and seemed red roses, budded."
"The face was of crystal, and engraved","Upon it the figures flashed and waved With zircons,","and beryls, and amethysts."
"It took a week to make,",and his trysts At night with the,Shadow were his alone.
Paul swore,not to speak till his,task was done.
The night that,the jewel was,worthy to give.
Paul watched the long hours of daylight live To the,"faintest streak; then lit his light, And sharp against the wall's pure white",The outline of the Shadow started Into form.
His burning-hearted Words,so long imprisoned swelled To,tumbling speech.
"Like one compelled, He told the lady all","his love, And holding out the watch above His head, he","knelt, imploring some Littlest sign."
The,Shadow,was dumb.
"Weeks passed, Paul worked in fevered","haste, And everything he made he",placed Before his lady.
The Shadow,kept Its perfect,passiveness.
He wooed her with the work,"of his hands, He waited for those dear",commands She never gave.
"No word, no motion,",Eased the ache of his,devotion.
His days passed in a,"strain of toil, His nights burnt up",in a seething coil.
"Seasons shot by,",uncognisant,He worked.
The Shadow,came to haunt Even,his days.
Sometimes quite plain He,saw on the wall the blackberry stain Of,his lady's picture.
No sun was bright,Enough to dazzle that,from his sight.
Then he,would curse Himself,and her!
"And more, the beauty","he could not make, And give her,",for her comfort's sake!
"He would beat his weary, empty hands Upon","the table, would hold up strands Of silver and gold, and ask her",why She scorned the best which he could buy.
He would pray as to,"some high-niched saint, That she would cure him of",the taint Of failure.
He would clutch the wall With his bleeding,"fingers, if she should fall He could catch, and","hold her, and make her live!"
With sobs he would,ask her to forgive All,he had done.
"And broken, spent, He would call himself",impertinent; Presumptuous; a tradesman; a nothing;,driven To madness by the sight of Heaven.
"There were days when he wooed as a lover,","sighed In tenderness, spoke to his bride, Urged her to","patience, said his skill Should break the spell."
A man's sworn will,"Could compass life, even","that, he knew."
He,would prove,it true!
The edge of,the Shadow never,blurred.
The lips of the,Shadow never,stirred.
He would climb on chairs,"to reach her lips, And pat her",hair with his finger-tips.
"Then, deadly sick, He would lie in a swoon","for hours, while thick Phantasmagoria crowded his","brain, And his body shrieked in the clutch of pain."
"The crisis passed, he would wake and smile With a vacant","joy, half-imbecile And quite confused, not being certain Why he was suffering; a curtain",Fallen over the tortured mind beguiled His sorrow.
Like a little child He would play with his watches,"and gems, with glee Calling the Shadow to look and see How the spots",on the ceiling danced prettily When he flashed his stones.
"""Mother, the green Has",slid so cunningly in between,The blue and the yellow.
"Oh,",please look,down!
One morning he threw the street door,"wide On coming in, and his vigorous stride Made the",tools on his table rattle and jump.
In his hands he carried a,"new-burst clump Of laurel blossoms, whose smooth-barked",stalks Were pliant with sap.
As a husband talks To,"the wife he left an hour ago,",Paul spoke to the Shadow.
"""Dear, you know To-day the calendar calls","it Spring, And I woke this morning gathering","Asphodels, in my dreams, for you."
So I rushed out to see what flowers blew Their pink-and-purple-scented,"souls Across the town-wind's dusty scrolls, And made the approach to the Market",Square A garden with smells and sunny air.
I feel so well and,"happy to-day, I think I shall",take a Holiday.
And to-night,we will have a,little treat.
I am going,to bring you something,to eat!
""" He looked at",the Shadow,anxiously.
It was,quite grave and,silent.
He Shut the outer,door and came And leant,against the window-frame.
"""Dearest,"" he said, ""we",live apart Although I,bear you in my heart.
We look,out each from a different,world.
At any moment,we may be hurled,Asunder.
They follow their,"orbits, we Obey their laws",entirely.
"Now you must come, or I go there,",Unless we are willing to live the flare Of,a lighted instant and have it gone.
""" A bee in",the laurels began,to drone.
A loosened,petal fluttered,prone.
"""Man grows by eating, if you eat","You will be filled with our life, sweet",Will be our planet in your mouth.
"If not, I must parch in death's wide","drouth Until I gain to where you are, And give you myself",in whatever star May happen.
Is it,not ordered,cleverly?
""" The Shadow, bloomed","like a plum, and clear,",Hung in the sunlight.
It,did,not hear.
Paul slipped away,as the dusk began To,dim the little shop.
He ran To the nearest,"inn, and chose with care As much",as his thin purse could bear.
"Returning, he brushed his","tools aside, And laid across the table",a wide Napkin.
He put a glass and,"plate On either side,",in duplicate.
"Over the lady's,","excellent With loveliness,",the laurels bent.
In the centre the,"white-flaked pastry stood, And beside",it the wine flask.
Red as blood Was the wine,which should bring the lustihood Of human,life to his lady's veins.
He put meat on her,"plate and filled her glass, And waited",what should come to pass.
The Shadow,lay quietly on,the wall.
From the street outside,"came a watchman's call ""A",cloudy night.
Rain,beginning,to fall.
""" And still",he,waited.
The clock's,slow tick Knocked on the,silence.
He filled his own glass,full of wine; From his pocket,he took a paper.
"The twine Was knotted,",and he searched a knife From,his jumbled tools.
The cord of,life Snapped as he cut,the little string.
He knew,that he must do the,thing He feared.
"He shook powder into the wine,",And holding it up so the candle's shine Sparked a,"ruby through its heart, He drank it."
"""Dear, never",apart,Again!
You have said,it was mine,to do.
"It is done, and",I am come,to you!
""" Paul Jannes let","the empty wine-glass fall,",And held out his arms.
The insentient wall Stared,"down at him with its cold,",white glare Unstained!
The Shadow,was not,there!
Paul clutched,and tore at his tightening,throat.
"He felt the veins in his body bloat,",And the hot blood run like fire and stones Along,the sides of his cracking bones.
But he laughed as he staggered,"towards the door, And he laughed aloud",as he sank on the floor.
The Coroner took the,"body away, And the watches were",sold that Saturday.
The Auctioneer said,"one could seldom buy Such watches,",and the prices were high.
Holy Mother,"of God, Merciful",Mary.
I am,very,weary.
I have come from a village,"miles away, all day I have been coming,",and I ache for such far roaming.
I cannot walk as,"light as I used, and my",thoughts grow confused.
I am,heavier,than I was.
Mary,"Mother, you",know the cause!
Beautiful Holy,"Lady, take my shame",away from me!
Let this fear be only,"seeming, let it be that I",am dreaming.
For months I have,"hoped it was so, now I am",afraid I know.
"Lady, why should this","be shame, just because I",haven't got his name.
"He loved me, yes,","Lady, he did, and he couldn't",keep it hid.
We,meant to,marry.
Why did,he,die?
That day when they told me he had gone,"down in the avalanche, and could not be found until","the snow melted in Spring, I did nothing."
I,could,not cry.
Why,should,he die?
Why should he,die and his,child live?
His little child,"alive in me, for",my comfort.
"No, Good","God, for my",misery!
"I cannot face the shame, to be","a mother, and not married, and the poor child to",be reviled for having no father.
"Merciful Mother,","Holy Virgin, take away",this sin I did.
Let the,baby,not be.
Only take,the stigma,off of me!
I have told,"no one but you, Holy",Mary.
"My mother would call me ""whore"", and spit","upon me; the priest would have me repent, and have",the rest of my life spent in a convent.
"I am no whore, no","bad woman, he loved me, and",we were to be married.
I carried him always in,"my heart, what did it matter if I",gave him the least part of me too?
"You were a virgin, Holy","Mother, but you had a son, you know there",are times when a woman must give all.
There is some,call to give and,hold back nothing.
I swear I obeyed,"God then, and this child who lives",in me is the sign.
"He is dead,","my beautiful,",strong man!
I shall never,feel him caress,me again.
This is,the only baby,I shall have.
"Oh, Holy","Virgin, protect",my baby!
"My little,",helpless,baby!
"He will look like his father,",and he will be as fast a runner,and as good a shot.
Not that he,shall be no scholar,neither.
How can I,"think such things, I",am not good.
My father will have nothing,"to do with my boy, I shall be",an outcast thing.
"Oh, Mother of our","Lord God, be merciful, take",away my shame!
Let my body,be as it was before,he came.
No little baby for,me to keep underneath my,heart for those long months.
To live,for and to get comfort,from.
I cannot,go home and tell my,mother.
She is,so hard and,righteous.
She never loved my,"father, and we were born for","duty, not for love."
I,cannot,face it.
"Holy Mother,",take my baby,away!
Take away,my little,baby!
I don't,"want it, I",can't bear it!
And I,"shall have nothing,",nothing!
Just be,known as a,good girl.
Have other men want to,"marry me, whom I could not touch,",after having known my man.
"He is gone, my man, I shall","never hear him or feel him again,",but I could not touch another.
I would rather,lie under the snow with my,own man in my arms!
So I shall,live on,and on.
Just a,good,woman.
With nothing to warm my,"heart where he lay, and where he left his",baby for me to care for.
I shall not,"be quite human,",I think.
Merely,a stone-dead,creature.
They will,respect,me.
What do,I care,for respect!
You didn't care for,people's tongues when you were,carrying our Lord Jesus.
God had my man give me,"my baby, when He knew that He was going",to take him away.
His lips will comfort,"me, his hands will",soothe me.
"All day I will work at my lace-making, and",all night I will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed,Angels to cover him with their wings.
"Dear Mother,",what is it that,sings?
I hear voices,"singing, and lovely silver",trumpets through it all.
They seem just,on the other,side of the wall.
Let me,"keep my baby, Holy",Mother.
He is only a poor lace-maker's,"baby, with a stain upon him, but give me strength",to bring him up to be a man.
Tang of fruitage in the air; Red,boughs bursting everywhere; Shimmering of seeded,grass; Hooded gentians all a'mass.
"Warmth of earth, and cloudless wind Tearing","off the husky rind, Blowing feathered seeds to","fall By the sun-baked, sheltering wall."
Beech trees in a golden,"haze; Hardy sumachs all ablaze, Glowing",through the silver birches.
How that,pine tree shouts,and lurches!
From the sunny,"door-jamb high, Swings the shell",of a butterfly.
Scrape of insect,violins Through the stubble,shrilly dins.
Every blade's a minaret Where,"a small muezzin's set, Loudly calling us",to pray At the miracle of day.
Then the purple-lidded night Westering,"comes, her footsteps light Guided by the radiant",boon Of a sickle-shaped new moon.
"In the brown water, Thick and silver-sheened","in the sunshine, Liquid and cool in the","shade of the reeds, A pike dozed."
Lost among the,shadows of stems He,lay unnoticed.
Suddenly he flicked his,"tail, And a green-and-copper brightness Ran",under the water.
Out from under the reeds,"Came the olive-green light, And orange",flashed up Through the sun-thickened water.
"So the fish passed across the pool, Green and copper,","A darkness and a gleam, And the blurred reflections of the willows",on the opposite bank Received it.
Where is,"she, the woman",who wore it?
The scent of,her lingers,and drugs me!
"A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush","the scarf down on my face, And gulp in the warmth and the","blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens."
Around me are,"columns of marble, and","a diapered, sun-flickered pavement."
Rose-leaves blow,and patter against,it.
Below the,stone steps a lute,tinkles.
A jar of green,jade throws its shadow,half over the floor.
A big-bellied Frog hops through the sunlight,"and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin, Sunk",in the black and white marble.
The west wind has lifted a scarf On,"the seat close beside me, the blue of it is",a violent outrage of colour.
She draws it more closely,"about her, and it ripples beneath",her slight stirring.
How loud clocks can tick,"when a room is empty,",and one is alone!
"My daffodil-crowned,",Slim and without,sandals!
As the sudden spurt of flame upon darkness,"So my eyeballs are startled with you, Supple-limbed youth among","the fruit-trees, Light runner through tasselled orchards."
You are an almond flower,unsheathed Leaping and flickering between,the budded branches.
As I would free the white almond,from the green husk So would I strip your,"trappings off, Beloved."
And fingering the smooth and,polished kernel I should see that in my hands,glittered a gem beyond counting.
The neighbour sits,in his window and,plays the flute.
"From my bed I can hear him, And the round","notes flutter and tap about the room, And hit against each","other, Blurring to unexpected chords."
"It is very beautiful,","With the little flute-notes all about me,",In the darkness.
"In the daytime, The neighbour",eats bread and onions with one hand And,copies music with the other.
He is fat and has a bald,"head, So I do not look at him, But",run quickly past his window.
There is always,"the sky to look at, Or the",water in the well!
"But when night comes and he plays his flute, I","think of him as a young man, With gold seals hanging from his","watch, And a blue coat with silver buttons."
You are beautiful and faded Like,an old opera tune Played upon a harpsichord; Or,like the sun-flooded silks Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.
In your eyes Smoulder the fallen roses,"of out-lived minutes, And the perfume of your soul Is vague and","suffusing, With the pungence of sealed spice-jars."
"Your half-tones delight me,",And I grow mad with gazing,At your blent colours.
My vigour is,"a new-minted penny, Which",I cast at your feet.
Gather it up,"from the dust, That its sparkle",may amuse you.
"Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,","Where trickle and plash the fountains, Marble fountains,",yellowed with much water.
Splashing down moss-tarnished steps,"It falls, the water; And the air",is throbbing with it.
With its,gurgling,and running.
With its,"leaping, and","deep, cool murmur."
And I,wished for night,and you.
I wanted to see,"you in the swimming-pool, White and shining in",the silver-flecked water.
"While the moon rode over the garden,","High in the arch of night, And the scent of the",lilacs was heavy with stillness.
"Night, and the","water, and you in your","whiteness, bathing!"
Guarded within the old red wall's,"embrace, Marshalled like soldiers in gay company,",The tulips stand arrayed.
Here infantry,Wheels out into,the sunlight.
What bold grace Sets,"off their tunics, white with",crimson lace!
"Here are platoons of gold-frocked cavalry,",With scarlet sabres tossing in the eye Of purple,"batteries, every gun in place."
"Forward they come, with flaunting","colours spread, With torches burning, stepping out","in time To some quick, unheard march."
Our ears,"are dead, We cannot",catch the tune.
In pantomime,Parades that,army.
With our utmost,powers We hear the wind stream,through a bed of flowers.

He whistled a little frivolous tune Which he felt,"to be pulsing with ecstasy, For he thought that success always followed","desire, Such a very superlative fool was he."
A maiden came by on an ambling,"mule, Her gown was rose-red and her kerchief blue, On her lap",she carried a basket of eggs.
"Thought the fool,","""There is certainly",room for two.
""" So he jauntily swaggered",towards the maid And put out,his hand to the bridle-rein.

And the,"fool got up, for",his heart was cheered.
He stood in the midst,"of the long, white road And swept off his",cap till it touched the ground.
"""Ah, Reverent Sir, well","met,"" said the fool, ""A worthier transport",never was found.
"""I pray you allow me to","mount with you, Your palfrey seems",both sturdy and young.
""" The abbot looked up",from the holy book And cried out in,"anger, ""Hold your tongue!"
"""How dare you obstruct the King's","highroad, You saucy varlet,",get out of my way.
""" Then he gave the fool a","cut with his whip And leaving him smarting,",he rode away.
"The fool was angry,","the fool was sore, And he cursed",the folly of monks and maids.
"""If I could but meet with a","man,"" sighed the fool, ""For a woman fears,",and a friar upbraids.
""" Then he saw a flashing of distant steel And the","clanking of harness greeted his ears, And up the road journeyed","knights-at-arms, With waving plumes and glittering spears."
The fool took notice,"and slowly arose, Not quite",so sure was his foolish heart.
If priests and women,would none of him Was it likely,a knight would take his part?
"They sang as they rode, these lusty boys, When","one chanced to turn toward the highway's side, ""There's a sorry","figure of fun,"" jested he, ""Well, Sirrah!"
"move back, there",is scarce room,to ride.
""" Then the",company halted,and laughed out loud.
"""Was such a",request ever,made to a knight?

"Purple tree-shadows crept over the road, The level","sun flung an orange light, And the fool laid his head on the hard, gray",stone And wept as he realized advancing night.
"A great, round moon rose over a hill And the","steady wind blew yet more cool; And crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed,",For at last he knew he was only a fool.

Is it a mosaic,Of coloured stones which curiously,are wrought Into a pattern?
Softly the water ripples Against,"the canoe's curving side, Softly the birch trees rustle",Flinging over us branches wide.
"From the shore come the scents of a garden,",And between a gap in the trees A proud white statue,"glimmers In cold, disdainful ease."

But the moon in her wayward beauty Is,"ever and always the same, As lovely as when upon",Latmos She watched till Endymion came.

All round us the secret of Nature Is telling,"itself to our sight, We may guess at her meaning but",never Can know the full mystery of night.
"But her power of enchantment is on us,","We bow to the spell which she weaves, Made up of the murmur",of waves And the manifold whisper of leaves.

"Look, Dear,",how bright the moonlight,is to-night!
See where it casts the,shadow of that tree Far out,upon the grass.
It seems as though the garden which you love Were like,"a swinging censer, its incense Floating before us as a",reverent act To sanctify and bless our night of love.

O Winding roads that,"I know so well, Every twist and","turn, every hollow and hill!"
They are set in my,heart to a pulsing tune Gay as a,honey-bee humming in June.
O Uphill,roads and roads,that dip down!
"You curl your sun-spattered length along, And your march",is beaten into a song By the softly ringing hoofs of a,horse And the panting breath of the dogs I love.
The pageant of Autumn,follows its course And the blue sky of,Autumn laughs above.
"And the song and the country become as one, I see","it as music, I hear it as light; Prismatic and shimmering, trembling","to tone, The land of desire, my soul's delight."
And always it beats in my listening,"ears With the gentle thud of a horse's stride, With the swift-falling steps","of many dogs, Following, following at my side."
O Roads,that journey to,fairyland!
How,still it,is!
What sound is,that which echoes,through the wood?
Is it the,reedy note of an,oaten pipe?
Perchance a minute more will see the brood,"Of the shaggy forest god, and on his lip Will",rest the rushes he is wont to play.
His train in woven baskets bear ripe fruit And weave a,"dance with ropes of gray acorns, So light their touch the grasses scarcely",sway As they the measure tread to the lilting flute.
't is only,Fancy thus,adorns.
A cloud drifts,idly over the,shining sun.
How damp,"it seems, how silent, still,",and strange!
Surely 't was here some,"tragedy was done, And here the",chorus sang each coming change?
The tread of,sandalled feet comes,noiselessly.
"The silence almost is a sound, and dreams Take on",the semblances of finite things; So potent is the spell that what but,"seems Elsewhere, is lifted here on Fancy's wings."
"The little woodland theatre seems to wait, All","tremulous with hope and wistful joy, For something that is sure to","come at last, Some deep emotion, satisfying, great."
"It grows a living presence,","bold and shy, Cradling the future",in a glorious past.
The octagon tower casts a shade Cool and,"gray like a cutlass blade; In sun-baked vines the cicalas spin,",The little green lizards run out and in.
A sail dips over,"the ocean's rim, And bubbles",rise to the fountain's brim.
"Slowly she walks to the balustrade, Idly",notes how the blossoms fade In the sun's caress; then crosses where,The shadow shelters a carven chair.
"Within its curve, supine","she lies, And wearily closes",her tired eyes.
"The minstrel beseeches his silver strings, And holding the lady","spellbound, sings: -- Down the road to Avignon, The long, long road to Avignon, Across","the bridge to Avignon, One morning in the spring."
"Clouds sail over the distant trees, Petals","are shaken down by the breeze, They fall on the terrace tiles","like snow; The sighing of waves sounds, far below."
A humming-bird kisses,the lips of a rose Then laden with honey,and love he goes.
"Step by step, and","he comes to her, Fearful lest",she suddenly stir.
"Sunshine and silence, and each to each, The","lute and his singing their only speech; He leans above her, her eyes","unclose, The humming-bird enters another rose."
The minstrel,hushes his silver,strings.
The beating,of humming-birds',wings!
"Down the road to Avignon, The long, long","road to Avignon, Across the bridge to","Avignon, One morning in the spring."
I hear the sigh The goaded,"city gives, not day Nor night can ease her","heart, her anguished labours stay."
"Below, straight streets, monotonous, From north and south,","from east and west, Stretch glittering; and luminous Above, one tower",tops the rest And holds aloft man's constant quest: Time!
"Joyless emblem of the greed Of millions, robber","of the best Which earth can give, the vulgar creed Has seared upon",the night its flaming ruthless screed.
Whose soothing presence,brings The quiet shining,of the stars.
Whose cloak of darkness clings So,intimately close that scars Are,hid from our own eyes.
"Beggars By day, our wealth is having night","To burn our souls before altars Dim and tree-shadowed, where the","light Is shed from a young moon, mysteriously bright."
Where art,"thou hiding,",where thy peace?
This is the,"hour, but",thou art not.
Will waking,tumult never,cease?
Hast thou,thy votary,forgot?
"Nature forsakes this man-begot And festering wilderness,","and now The long still hours are here, no jot Of dear communing do","I know; Instead the glaring, man-filled city groans below!"
On winter nights beside the,nursery fire We read the fairy,"tale, while glowing coals Builded its pictures."
The foliage seemed,"to rustle in the wind, A silent","murmur, carved in still, gray stone."
"A sudden blare of trumpets, and",the throng About the entrance parted as the guests Filed,singly in with rare and precious gifts.
Our eager fancies,"noted all they brought, The glorious,",unattainable delights!
But always there was one,unbidden guest Who cursed the child,and left it bitterness.
"The fire falls asunder, all is","changed, I am no more a child, and what I see","Is not a fairy tale, but life, my life."
"The gifts are there, the many pleasant things:","Health, wealth, long-settled friendships, with a name Which honors all who bear it, and",the power Of making words obedient.
This is much; But overshadowing,"all is still the curse, That never shall I",be fulfilled by love!
Along the parching,highroad of the world No other,soul shall bear mine company.
So I behold my visions on,"the ground No longer radiant, an ignoble","heap Of broken, dusty glass."
"And so, unlit, Even by","hope or faith, my dragging steps Force me",forever through the passing days.
"You came to me bearing bright roses, Red",like the wine of your heart; You twisted them into a garland,To set me aside from the mart.
Red roses to crown,"me your lover, And I walked",aureoled and apart.
"Enslaved and encircled,","I bore it, Proud token of",my gift to you.
"The petals waned paler,","and shriveled, And dropped; and the",thorns started through.
Bitter thorns to proclaim,"me your lover, A diadem",woven with rue.
"Dear Bessie, would my tired rhyme Had force","to rise from apathy, And shaking off its",lethargy Ring word-tones like a Christmas chime.
"But in my soul's high belfry, chill The bitter","wind of doubt has blown, The summer swallows all have","flown, The bells are frost-bound, mute and still."
Upon the crumbling boards the snow,"Has drifted deep, the clappers hang Prismed with icicles,",their clang Unheard since ages long ago.
"The rope I pull is stiff and cold, My","straining ears detect no sound Except a sigh, as round and",round The wind rocks through the timbers old.
"Below, I know the church is bright With","haloed tapers, warm with prayer; But here I only",feel the air Of icy centuries of night.
Beneath my feet the snow is lit And,"gemmed with colours, red, and blue, Topaz, and green, where light",falls through The saints that in the windows sit.
"Here darkness seems a spectred thing, Voiceless","and haunting, while the stars Mock with a light of long",dead years The ache of present suffering.
"Silent and winter-killed I stand, No carol","hymns my debt to you; But take this frozen thought in lieu,",And thaw its music in your hand.
Thou father of the children of my brain By thee,"engendered in my willing heart, How can I thank thee for this gift of","art Poured out so lavishly, and not in vain."
"What thou created never more can die, Thy","fructifying power lives in me And I conceive, knowing it","is by thee, Dear other parent of my poetry!"
"All unknown, By me unguessed, by thee","not even dreamed, A tree has blossomed in a night","that seemed Of stubborn, barren wood."
For thou hast sown This,seed of beauty in,a ground of truth.
"Humbly I dedicate myself, and",yet I tremble with a sudden fear to set New,music ringing through my fading youth.
His eyelids burnt and quivered with the,"strain Of looking, and against his temples beat The all","enshrouding, suffocating dark."
"He stumbled, lurched, and struck against a door That opened,","and a howl of obscene mirth Grated his senses, wallowing on the","floor Lay men, and dogs and women in the dirt."
"He sickened, loathing","it, and as he gazed The candle guttered,","flared, and then went out."
"Then as he leaned Unconscious where,","the great oak door blew back And cast him,","bruised and dripping, in the church."
His eyes from long sojourning in,the night Were blinded now as by some glorious sun;,He slowly crawled toward the altar steps.
"He could not think, for heavy in his",ears An organ boomed majestic harmonies; He,only knew that what he saw was light!
He bowed himself before,a cross of flame And shut his eyes,in fear lest it should fade.
Blue through the window,"burns the twilight; Heavy, through trees,",blows the warm south wind.
"Glistening, against","the chill, gray sky light, Wet, black",branches are barred and entwined.
"Sodden and spongy,",the scarce-green grass plot Dents into,pools where a foot has been.
Puddles lie spilt in,"the road a mass, not Of water,","but steel, with its cold, hard sheen."
Faint fades the fire,"on the hearth, its embers",Scattering wide at a stronger gust.
"Above, the old weathercock","groans, but remembers Creaking, to turn, in",its centuried rust.
"Dying, forlorn, in dreary sorrow, Wrapping the","mists round her withering form, Day sinks down; and in darkness to-morrow",Travails to birth in the womb of the storm.
Deeps of unhewn woods Alone,"can cherish thee, alone possess Thy quiet,",teeming vigor.
"This our crime: Not to have worshipped, marred","by alien moods That sole condition of all loveliness,","The dreaming lapse of slow, unmeasured time."
"Dawn fills the room, and penetrating,","bright, The silent sunbeams through the",window pour.
"And she lies sleeping, ignorant","of Fate, Enmeshed in listless dreams, her soul not yet Ripened",to bear the purport of this day.
The morning breeze scarce stirs,"the coverlet, A shadow falls",across the sunlight; wait!
A lark,is singing as,he flies away.
Beyond the ilex,"shadow glares the sun, Scorching against",the blue flame of the sky.
Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine Within,"a granite basin, under one The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp;",and I Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.
Another,year Is quick with,import.
Such,each year has,been.
"Unmoved thou watchest all, and all bequeath","Some jewel to thy diadem of power, Thou pledge",of greater majesty unseen.
A little garden on a,"bleak hillside Where deep the heavy, dazzling mountain",snow Lies far into the spring.
The sun's pale glow Is scarcely,able to melt patches wide About,the single rose bush.
All denied,Of nature's tender,ministries.
"But no, -- For wonder-working",faith has made it blow With flowers,many hued and starry-eyed.
A little,"garden, loved with a",great love!
Thou yellow,trumpeter of,laggard Spring!
Thou herald of,rich Summer's,myriad flowers!
"Always bold To stand erect,",full in the dazzling play Of April's,"sun, for thou hast caught his gold."
'T is you that,"are the music,",not your song.
"The song is but a door which, opening","wide, Lets forth the pent-up melody inside, Your spirit's","harmony, which clear and strong Sings but of you."
"Throughout your whole life long Your songs, your thoughts, your","doings, each divide This perfect beauty; waves within a tide,",Or single notes amid a glorious throng.
The song of earth has many different,chords; Ocean has many moods and many,tones Yet always ocean.
In the damp Spring woods The painted,"trillium smiles, while crisp pine cones Autumn",alone can ripen.
So is this One,music with a thousand,cadences.
So still it stands Surely,our own if we exert,our might.
"Never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam, Its glowing","flame would die if it were caught, Its value is that it doth always",seem But just a little farther on.
"Distraught, But lighted ever","onward, we are brought Upon our way","unknowing, in a dream."
Brave idolatry,Which can conceive,a hero!
"No deceit, No knowledge taught","by unrelenting years, Can quench this fierce,",untamable desire.
We know that what we,long for once achieved Will cease,to satisfy.
Be still our fears; If what,"we worship fail us, still the fire","Burns on, and it is much to have believed."
Must all of worth be travailled,"for, and those Life's brightest stars rise from",a troubled sea?
Must years go by in sad uncertainty,Leaving us doubting whose the conquering,"blows, Are we or Fate the victors?"
Time which shows All inner,"meanings will reveal, but we Shall",never know the upshot.
Sudden we lack The flash,"of insight, life grows drear and gray, And hour","follows hour, nerveless, slack."
"Austere arbiter of each man's fate, By",whom he learns that Nature's steadfast laws Are as decrees immutable;,O pause Your even forward march!
Not yet too late Teach me the needed,"lesson, when to wait Inactive as a ship when no",wind draws To stretch the loosened cordage.
What instinct forces,"man to journey on, Urged by a longing",blind but dominant!
Nothing he sees can,"hold him, nothing daunt His never",failing eagerness.
The sun Setting in splendour every night,has won His vassalage; those towers flamboyant Of airy,cloudland palaces now haunt His daylight wanderings.
The wind is singing through the,"trees to-night, A deep-voiced song of rushing",cadences And crashing intervals.
Above the tossing trees shines down,"a star, Quietly bright; this wild, tumultuous",joy Quickens nor dims its splendour.
And,"my mind, O",Star!
"is filled with your white light, from far,",So suffer me this one night to enjoy The freedom,of the onward sweeping wind.
"The path runs straight between the flowering rows, A","moonlit path, hemmed in by beds of bloom, Where phlox and marigolds dispute","for room With tall, red dahlias and the briar rose."
'T is reckless prodigality,which throws Into the night these wafts of rich perfume,Which sweep across the garden like a plume.
Over,the trees a single,bright star glows.
"How is it that, being gone,","you fill my days, And all the long",nights are made glad by thee?
"No loneliness is this, nor misery, But great content","that these should be the ways Whereby the Fancy, dreaming as she strays,",Makes bright and present what she would would be.
And who shall say if,the reality Is not,with dreams so pregnant.
""" It may",be vain,illusion.
"Alas, how few There are who strike in","us a chord we knew Existed, but so seldom",heard its tone We tremble at the half-forgotten sound.
The world is full of rude awakenings And heaven-born,"castles shattered to the ground, Yet still our human longing vainly",clings To a belief in beauty through all wrongs.
O stay,"your hand, and leave",my heart its songs!
What torture lurks within a single thought When,"grown too constant, and however kind, However welcome","still, the weary mind Aches with its presence."
Dull remembrance taught Remembers on unceasingly; unsought,The old delight is with us but to find That all recurring joy is,"pain refined, Become a habit, and we struggle, caught."
"You lie upon my heart as on a nest, Folded","in peace, for you can never know How crushed I am with",having you at rest Heavy upon my life.
I love you so,You bind my freedom from,its rightful quest.
In mercy,lift your drooping wings,and go.
I do not care to talk to you although Your,"speech evokes a thousand sympathies, And all my being's silent",harmonies Wake trembling into music.
When you go It is as if some,"sudden, dreadful blow Had severed all",the strings with savage ease.
"No, do not talk; but let",us rather seize This intimate,gift of silence which we know.
Others may guess your thoughts,"from what you say, As storms are guessed",from clouds where darkness broods.
To me the very essence of the day Reveals,its inner purpose and its moods; As poplars feel the rain and then straightway,Reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods.
Now you,are,come!
You tremble like a,"star Poised where, behind earth's","rim, the sun has set."
Your voice has sung across,"my heart, but numb And mute, I have",no tones to answer.
Far Within I kneel before,"you, speechless yet, And life ablaze with","beauty, I am dumb."
How empty,seems the town now,you are gone!
"A wilderness of sad streets, where gaunt walls Hide nothing","to desire; sunshine falls Eery, distorted, as it long","had shone On white, dead faces tombed in halls of stone."
"The whir of motors, stricken through with","calls Of playing boys, floats up at intervals; But all",these noises blur to one long moan.
What quest,is worth,pursuing?
And how strange,That other men still go,accustomed ways!
I hate their interest,in the things they,do.
A spectre-horde,repeating without change,An old routine.
Alone I know,"the days Are still-born, and the","world stopped, lacking you."
All night I wrestled with,a memory Which knocked insurgent,at the gates of thought.
The crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought Its,"disillusion; now I only cry For peace, for power to",forget the lie Which hope too long has whispered.
So I sought The sleep which,"would not come, and night was fraught With old",emotions weeping silently.
"I heard your voice again,",and knew the things Which you had promised,proved an empty vaunt.
I felt your clinging,hands while night's broad wings Cherished,our love in darkness.
From the lawn A,"sudden, quivering","birdnote, like a taunt."
My arms,held nothing but,the empty dawn.
To make a pavement for your feet,"I stripped My soul for you to walk upon, and slipped",Beneath your steps to soften all your ways.
But now my letters,are like blossoms pale We strew upon,a grave with hopeless tears.
"I ask no recompense, I shall not fail Although","you do not heed; the long, sad years Still pass, and still I scatter flowers","frail, And whisper words of love which no one hears."
Throughout the echoing chambers of my,brain I hear your words in mournful cadence toll Like some slow,passing-bell which warns the soul Of sundering darkness.
"Unrelenting, fain To batter down resistance, fall","again Stroke after stroke, insistent diastole, The bitter blows of truth,",until the whole Is hammered into fact made strangely plain.
Where shall,I look for,comfort?
Our worlds are drawn,"apart, our spirit's suns Divided,",and the light of mine burnt dim.
Now in the haunted,twilight I must,do Your will.
I grasp the cup which,"over-runs, And with my trembling",lips I touch the rim.
"""'I can't","get out', said the",starling.
""" Sterne's",'Sentimental,Journey'.
Forever the impenetrable wall Of self confines,"my poor rebellious soul, I never see the towering white clouds roll Before","a sturdy wind, save through the small Barred window of my jail."
I live a thrall With all my outer life,"a clipped, square hole, Rectangular; a fraction of a scroll",Unwound and winding like a worsted ball.
My thoughts are grown uneager and,"depressed Through being always mine, my fancy's wings Are",moulted and the feathers blown away.
I weary for desires never,"guessed, For alien passions, strange imaginings, To",be some other person for a day.
"White, glittering sunlight","fills the market square, Spotted",and sprigged with shadows.
"The market glows,","And flaunts, and clatters in",its busy care.
The law of duty urged that he,"should roam, Should sail from fog and chilly airs to",skies Clear with deceitful welcome.
"He had come With proud resolve,",but still his lonely eyes Ached with fatigue,at never seeing home.
Smoulderings Of sacrificial,fires burst their rings And blotted out,in smoke his lost domain.
"Bereft of courtiers,","only with his queen, From empty",palace down to empty quay.
No challenge,screamed from hostile,carabine.
"Boyish,",sympathetic,man!
Crumbled before,thy majesty,we bow.
The little gallery winds round about,"The middle of a most secluded room, Midway between",the ceiling and the floor.
"For books are more than books, they are the life, The very","heart and core of ages past, The reason why men lived, and worked, and","died, The essence and quintessence of their lives."
Silently waiting that from time to time It may be,given them to illuminate Dull daily facts with pristine radiance For,some long-waited-for affinity Who lingers yet in the deep womb of time.
The shifting sun pierces the young green leaves Of,"elm trees, newly coming into bud, And splashes on the floor and on","the books Through old, high, rounded windows, dim with age."
The noisy city-sounds of modern,life Float softened to us across,the old graveyard.
"The room is filled with a warm, mellow","light, No garish colours jar on our content,",The books upon the shelves are old and worn.
'T was no belated effort nor attempt To,"keep abreast with old as well as new That placed them here, tricked in a","modern guise, Easily got, and held in light esteem."
"A nothing truly, yet a link that binds All","ages to their own inheritance, And stretching backward, dim and","dimmer still, Is lost in a remote antiquity."
Grapes do not come of thorns nor figs of,"thistles, And even a great poet's divinest thought",Is coloured by the world he knows and sees.
"Nay, the little things Of daily","life it is which mold, and shape, And make him apt",for noble deeds and true.
"The long, still, fruitful hours slip away Shedding",their influences as they pass; We know ourselves the richer,to have sat Upon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams.
No other place to us,"were quite the same, No other dreams so potent","in their charm, For this is ours!"
The building simply bodies,forth a thought Peculiarly,inherent to the race.
"And we, descendants of that elder","time, Have learnt to love the very form in which The thought",has been embodied to our years.
It takes some time for moss and vines,to grow And warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls,Of stately buildings from the cold North Wind.
"The lichen of affection takes as long, Or","longer, ere it lovingly enfolds A place which since without it were","bereft, All stript and bare, shorn of its chiefest grace."
"Sea Shell, Sea","Shell, Sing me a","song, O Please!"
"Sea Shell, Sea","Shell, Sing of the things",you know so well.
Near where I live there is a,"lake As blue as blue can be, winds make",It dance as they go blowing by.
I think,it curtseys to,the sky.
It's just a lake of lovely flowers And,my Mamma says they are ours; But they are not like,"those we grow To be our very own, you know."
"We have a splendid garden, there Are lots","of flowers everywhere; Roses, and pinks, and four o'clocks","And hollyhocks, and evening stocks."
Mamma lets us,"pick them, but never Must we",pick any gentians -- ever!
For if we carried,them away They'd die of,homesickness that day.
My Grandpapa lives in a wonderful house,"With a great many windows and doors, There are stairs that go up, and","stairs that go down, And such beautiful, slippery floors."
"But of all of the rooms, even mother's and mine,","And the bookroom, and parlour and all, I like the green dining-room so",much the best Because of its ceiling and wall.
Right over your head is a funny round hole With,apples and pears falling through; There's a big bunch of grapes all purply,"and sweet, And melons and pineapples too."
"They tumble and tumble, but never come down Though I've","stood underneath a long while With my mouth open wide, for I always",have hoped Just a cherry would drop from the pile.
No matter how early I run there to look It,has always begun to fall through; And one night when at bedtime I,"crept in to see, It was falling by candle-light too."
"I am sure they are magical fruits, and each","one Makes you hear things, or see things, or go Forever invisible;","but it's no use, And of course I shall just never know."
For the ladder's too heavy,"to lift, and the chairs Are not nearly",so tall as I need.
"I've given up hope, and",I feel I shall die Without having,accomplished the deed.
"It's a little bit sad, when you seem very near","To adventures and things of that sort, Which nearly begin, and then",don't; and you know It is only because you are short.
Slipping softly through the,"sky Little horned, happy moon, Can you",hear me up so high?
Will you,come down,soon?
On my nursery,window-sill Will you stay,your steady flight?
And then float away,with me Through the,summer night?
"Brushing over tops of trees, Playing","hide and seek with stars, Peeping up through shiny",clouds At Jupiter or Mars.
I shall fill my lap with roses,"Gathered in the milky way, All to",carry home to mother.
what will,she,say!
"Little rocking,","sailing moon, Do you hear",me shout -- Ahoy!
Just a little,"nearer, moon, To please",a little boy.
High up in the apple,"tree climbing I go, With the sky","above me, the earth below."
Each branch is the step of,a wonderful stair Which leads to the,town I see shining up there.
"Climbing, climbing, higher and higher, The branches","blow and I see a spire, The gleam of a turret, the glint of a","dome, All sparkling and bright, like white sea foam."
"On and on, from bough to bough, The leaves are thick,","but I push my way through; Before, I have always had to stop,",But to-day I am sure I shall reach the top.
Today to the end of,"the marvelous stair, Where those glittering",pinacles flash in the air!
"Climbing, climbing, higher","I go, With the sky close above","me, the earth far below."
Naughty little,"speckled trout, Can't I",coax you to come out?
Is it such great fun,to play In the water,every day?
Do you pull the,Naiads' hair Hiding,in the lilies there?
Do you hunt for,"fishes' eggs, Or watch",tadpoles grow their legs?
Do the little trouts have school In some,"deep sun-glinted pool, And in recess play at tag",Round that bed of purple flag?
"I have tried so hard to catch you,",Hours and hours I've sat to watch you; But you never,"will come out, Naughty little speckled trout!"
"He shouts in the sails of the ships at sea, He","steals the down from the honeybee, He makes the forest trees rustle","and sing, He twirls my kite till it breaks its string."
"Laughing, dancing, sunny wind, Whistling,","howling, rainy wind, North, South, East and West, Each is",the wind I like the best.
"He calls up the fog and hides the hills, He whirls","the wings of the great windmills, The weathercocks love him and turn to","discover His whereabouts -- but he's gone, the rover!"
"The pine trees toss him their cones with glee, The","flowers bend low in courtesy, Each wave flings up a shower","of pearls, The flag in front of the school unfurls."
By day you cannot,see the sky For it is,up so very high.
"You look and look,",but it's so blue That you,can never see right through.
But when night comes it,"is quite plain, And all the",stars are there again.
They seem just like old,"friends to me, I've known them",all my life you see.
"There is the dipper first, and there Is","Cassiopeia in her chair, Orion's belt, the","Milky Way, And lots I know but cannot say."
"One group looks like a swarm of bees, Papa",says they're the Pleiades; But I think they must be the,toy Of some nice little angel boy.
Perhaps his jackstones which to-day He has,"forgot to put away, And left them lying on the",sky Where he will find them bye and bye.
I wish he'd,come and play,with me.
"We'd have such fun, for it would",be A most unusual thing for boys,To feel that they had stars for toys!
“We grasp our battle-spears:,we don our,breast-plates of hide.
The axles of,our chariots touch: our,short swords meet.
Standards obscure the,sun: the foe roll,up like clouds.
Arrows fall thick:,the warriors,press forward.
They menace,our ranks: they break,our line.
The left-hand trace-horse,is dead: the one on,the right is smitten.
The fallen horses,block our wheels: they impede,the yoke-horses!
” They grasp their jade,drum-sticks: they beat the,sounding drums.
Heaven decrees their,fall: the dread Powers,are angry.
The warriors,are all dead: they lie,on the moor-field.
They issued but shall,not enter: they went but,shall not return.
The plains are,flat and wide: the,way home is long.
Their swords lie beside,"them: their black bows, in",their hand.
Though their limbs were,"torn, their hearts could not",be repressed.
They were more than,brave: they were inspired with,the spirit of “Wu.

"To be an orphan,",To be fated to,be an orphan.
How,bitter is this,lot!
When my father and mother,were alive I used to ride in a carriage,With four fine horses.
"But when they both died,",My brother and sister-in-law Sent me out,to be a merchant.
In the south I travelled,to the “Nine Rivers” And in the east as,far as Ch’i and Lu.
My brother,told me to get,ready the dinner.
My sister-in-law,told me to see after,the horses.
I was always going up,into the hall And running down,again to the parlour.
My,tears fell,like rain.
In the morning they,"sent me to draw water, I",didn’t get back till night-fall.
My hands,were all sore And,I had no shoes.
I walked the cold,earth Treading on thorns,and brambles.
As I stopped to,"pull out the thorns, How",bitter my heart was!
My tears fell and,fell And I went on,sobbing and sobbing.
In winter I,have no great-coat; Nor in,"summer, thin clothes."
It is,no pleasure to be,alive.
I had rather quickly,leave the earth And go beneath,the Yellow Springs.
The April winds blow,And the grass is,growing green.
In the third month--silkworms,"and mulberries, In",the sixth month--the melon-harvest.
I went out with the melon-cart,And just as I was coming home The,melon-cart turned over.
"The people who came to help me were few, But","the people who ate the melons were many, All they left me",was the stalks-- To take home as fast as I could.
My brother and sister-in-law,"were harsh, They asked me all sorts",of awful questions.
Why does,everyone in the,village hate me?
I want to write a letter and send it To my mother,"and father under the earth, And tell them I can’t go on any",longer Living with my brother and sister-in-law.
She had been ill for years,and years; She sent for me,to say something.
She couldn’t say what she,wanted Because of the tears that,kept coming of themselves.
“I have burdened you with,"orphan children, With orphan",children two or three.
Don’t let our children,go hungry or cold; If they do,"wrong, don’t slap or beat them."

"” Last she said, “When I carried them in",my arms they had no clothes And now their,jackets have no linings.
_ I shut the doors and,barred the windows And left the,motherless children.
When I got,to the market and met,"my friends, I wept."
I sat down,and could not go,with them.
I asked them,to buy some cakes for,my children.
In the presence,of my friends I,sobbed and cried.
I tried not,"to grieve, but sorrow",would not cease.
I felt in,my pocket and gave my,friends some money.
When I got home I found,my children Calling to be taken,into their mother’s arms.
I walked up and down,in the empty room This way,and that a long while.
Then I went away from,it and said to myself “I will forget,and never speak of her again.
” In the eastern,"quarter dawn breaks, the stars",flicker pale.
The morning cock,at Ju-nan mounts the,wall and crows.
"The songs are over,","the clock run down, but still",the feast is set.
The moon grows dim,and the stars are few; morning,has come to the world.
At a thousand gates and ten thousand,doors the fish-shaped keys turn; Round the Palace and up by the,"Castle, the crows and magpies are flying."
We go to the,Golden Palace: We,set out the jade cups.
We summon the,honoured guests To enter,at the Golden Gate.
They enter at the,Golden Gate And go to,the Golden Hall.
In the Eastern Kitchen the,meat is sliced and ready-- Roast beef,and boiled pork and mutton.
The Master,of the Feast hands round,the wine.
The harp-players,sound their clear,chords.
The cups are pushed aside and,we face each other at chess: The rival,pawns are marshalled rank against rank.
The fire glows and the,smoke puffs and curls; From the incense-burner rises,a delicate fragrance.
The clear wine has made,our cheeks red; Round the table,joy and peace prevail.
May those who shared in this,day’s delight Through countless autumns enjoy,like felicity.
At fifteen I,"went with the army, At",fourscore I came home.
On the way I met a man,"from the village, I asked him",who there was at home.
“That over there is your,"house, All covered over with",trees and bushes.
” Rabbits had run in,"at the dog-hole, Pheasants flew down from",the beams of the roof.
In the courtyard was growing,"some wild grain; And by the well,",some wild mallows.
I’ll boil the grain and,"make porridge, I’ll pluck the",mallows and make soup.
Soup and porridge,"are both cooked, But there is no",one to eat them with.
I went out and looked,"towards the east, While tears fell",and wetted my clothes.
In a narrow road where there,was not room to pass My carriage met,the carriage of a young man.
And while his axle was touching,my axle In the narrow road I,asked him where he lived.
“The place where I live is easy,"enough to find, Easy to find and",difficult to forget.
In the midst of the courtyard grows,"a cassia-tree,-- And candles on its branches",flaring away in the night.
” They fought south,"of the Castle, They died",north of the wall.
They died,in the moors and were,not buried.
Their flesh,was the,food of crows.
“Tell the crows we are not,afraid; We have died in the moors,and cannot be buried.
"Crows, how can our",bodies escape,you?
” The waters flowed deep,And the rushes in,the pool were dark.
The riders fought,and were slain: Their horses,wander neighing.
By the,bridge there was,a house.
Was it,"south, was it",north?
The harvest,was never,gathered.
How can,we give you your,offerings?
You served your,"Prince faithfully,",Though all in vain.
"I think of you, faithful",soldiers; Your service shall not,be forgotten.
For in the morning you,went out to battle And at,night you did not return.
I went out at,the eastern gate: I never,thought to return.
But I came back to,the gate with my heart,full of sorrow.
There was not a peck of,rice in the bin: There was not a coat,hanging on the pegs.
So I took,my sword and went,towards the gate.
My wife and child clutched at my coat,and wept: “Some people want to be rich and grand: I only,want to share my porridge with you.
"Above, we have the blue waves","of the sky: Below, the yellow",face of this little child.
"” “Dear wife,",I cannot,stay.
Soon,it will be,too late.
When one is growing,old One cannot put,things off.
” She went up the mountain to pluck,wild herbs; She came down the mountain and,met her former husband.
She knelt down and asked,her former husband “What do you,find your new wife like?
"” “My new wife, although her","talk is clever, Cannot charm me",as my old wife could.
In beauty of,face there is not,much to choose.
But in usefulness,they are not at,all alike.
My new wife comes in from,the road to meet me; My old wife always,came down from her tower.
My new wife is clever,at embroidering silk; My old,wife was good at plain sewing.
Of silk embroidery one,can do an inch a day; Of plain,"sewing, more than five feet."
Putting her silks by the side,"of your sewing, I see that the new",will not compare with the old.
” My love is,living To the,south of the Great Sea.
What shall,I send,to greet him?
Two pearls and a comb,of tortoise-shell: I’ll send them to him packed,in a box of jade.
They tell me he is not true: They tell me,"he dashed my box to the ground, Dashed it to the ground and burnt",it And scattered its ashes to the wind.
From this day to the ends,"of time I must never think of him,",Never again think of him.
"The cocks are crowing, And",the dogs are barking-- My brother,and his wife will soon know.
The autumn wind is,blowing; The morning,wind is sighing.
In a moment the,sun will rise in the east And,then _it_ too will know.
I am a prisoner,"in the hands of the enemy, Enduring",the shame of captivity.
My bones stick out and,my strength is gone Through not getting,enough to eat.
My brother is a,Mandarin And his horses,are fed on maize.
Why can’t he spare a,little money To send,and ransom me?
If you were riding in a coach,"And I were wearing a “li,” And one day we met","in the road, You would get down and bow."
If you were carrying a “tēng” And I,"were riding on a horse, And one day we met in",the road I would get down for you.
I want to be your,friend For ever and ever without,break or decay.
"How swiftly it dries, The","dew on the garlic-leaf, The dew that dries",so fast To-morrow will fall again.
But he whom we,carry to the grave Will never,more return.
What man’s,land is the,graveyard?
It is the crowded,"home of ghosts,-- Wise and foolish",shoulder to shoulder.
The King of the,Dead claims them all; Man’s fate,knows no tarrying.
"On and on, always","on and on Away from you,",parted by a life-parting.
Going from one another,"ten thousand “li,” Each in a different",corner of the World.
The way between is,"difficult and long, Face to face",how shall we meet again?
Since we parted the time,"is already long, Daily my",clothes hang looser round my waist.
Floating clouds obscure the,"white sun, The wandering one",has quite forgotten home.
Thinking of you has made,"me suddenly old, The months and",years swiftly draw to their close.
I’ll put you out of my,mind and forget for ever And try,with all my might to eat and thrive.
"Green, green,",The grass by the,river-bank.
"Thick, thick, The",willow trees in,the garden.
"Sad, sad,",The lady in,the tower.
"White, white,",Sitting at the casement,window.
"Fair, fair,",Her red-powdered,face.
"Small, small,",She puts out her,pale hand.
Once she,was a,dancing-house girl.
Now she,is a wandering,man’s wife.
The wandering,"man went, but did",not return.
It is hard,alone to keep,an empty bed.
"Green, green, The",cypress on,the mound.
"Firm, firm,",The boulder,in the stream.
Man’s life lived within this,"world, Is like the sojourning of",a hurried traveller.
A cup of wine together,"will make us glad, And a little",friendship is no little matter.
Yoking my,chariot I urge my stubborn,horses.
I wander,about in the streets,of Wan and Lo.
In Lo Town,how fine,everything is!
The “Caps and,Belts” go seeking,each other out.
The great boulevards are,"intersected by lanes, Wherein",are the town-houses of Royal Dukes.
The two palaces stare,"at each other from afar, The",twin gates rise a hundred feet.
By prolonging the feast,"let us keep our hearts gay, And leave",no room for sadness to creep in.
Of this day’s glorious,feast and revel The pleasure and delight,are difficult to describe.
Plucking the lute they sent,"forth lingering sounds, The new melodies",in beauty reached the divine.
Skilful singers intoned,"the high words, Those who knew the tune heard",the trueness of their singing.
We sat there each with the same desire And,like thoughts by each unexpressed: “Man in the world lodging for a single life-time,Passes suddenly like dust borne on the wind.
Then let us hurry out with high steps And be,the first to reach the highways and fords: Rather than stay at home,wretched and poor For long years plunged in sordid grief.
” In the north-west there is,"a high house, Its top level",with the floating clouds.
Embroidered curtains thinly,"screen its windows, Its storied tower",is built on three steps.
From above there comes,"a noise of playing and singing,","The tune sounding, oh!"
Who can it,"be, playing so sad",a tune?
Surely it,must be Ch’i Liang’s,wife.
The tranquil “D” follows,"the wind’s rising, The middle",lay lingers indecisive.
"To each note, two or","three sobs, Her high will conquered by",overwhelming grief.
She does not regret that she,"is left so sad, But minds that so few",can understand her song.
She wants to become,those two wild geese That with beating,wings rise high aloft.
Crossing the river I,pluck hibiscus-flowers: In the orchid-swamps,are many fragrant herbs.
I gather,"them, but who shall",I send them to?
My love,is living in lands,far away.
I turn and look towards,my own country: The long road,stretches on for ever.
"The same heart, yet a different","dwelling: Always fretting, till",we are grown old!
A bright moon illumines,the night-prospect: The house-cricket chirrups on,the eastern wall.
The Handle of the,Pole-star points to the Beginning,of Winter.
The host of stars,is scattered over,the sky.
The white dew wets the,"moor-grasses,-- With sudden swiftness the",times and seasons change.
The autumn cicada,"sings among the trees, The swallows,","alas, whither are they gone?"
Once I had a,"same-house friend, He took flight and",rose high away.
He did not remember how,"once we went hand in hand, But left me like",footsteps behind one in the dust.
In the South is the Winnowing-fan,"and the Pole-star in the North, And a Herd-boy whose ox",has never borne the yoke.
A friend who is not firm as,a great rock Is of no profit,and idly bears the name.
In the courtyard there grows,"a strange tree, Its green leaves ooze",with a fragrant moisture.
Holding the branch I cut a,"flower from the tree, Meaning to send it away",to the person I love.
Its sweet,smell fills my sleeves,and lap.
The road is,"long, how shall I get",it there?
Such a thing is not fine enough,to send: But it may remind him of the time,that has past since he left.
Far away twinkles the,Herd-boy star; Brightly shines the Lady,of the Han River.
"Slender, slender",she plies her white,fingers.
"Click, click go",the wheels of her,spinning-loom.
At the end of the day,she has not finished her task; Her bitter,tears fall like streaming rain.
The Han River runs,shallow and clear; Set between,"them, how short a space!"
But the river water will not,"let them pass, Gazing at each other",but never able to speak.
Turning my,chariot I yoke my,horses and go.
On and on down the,long roads The autumn winds shake,the hundred grasses.
On every,"side, how desolate",and bare!
The things I meet are,"all new things, Their strangeness hastens",the coming of old age.
Prosperity,and decay each have their,season.
Success is bitter,when it is slow,in coming.
Man’s life is not metal,"or stone, He cannot far prolong",the days of his fate.
Suddenly,he follows in the,way of things that change.
Fame is the,only treasure that,endures.
The Eastern Castle,stands tall and high; Far and wide,stretch the towers that guard it.
The whirling wind uprises,and shakes the earth; The autumn grasses,grow thick and green.
The four seasons alternate,"without pause, The year’s end hurries",swiftly on.
The Bird of the Morning Wind,is stricken with sorrow; The frail,cicada suffers and is hard pressed.
"Free and clear, let",us loosen the,bonds of our hearts.
Why should we,go on always,restraining and binding?
In Yen and Chao are,"many fair ladies, Beautiful people",with faces like jade.
Their clothes,are made all of,silk gauze.
They stand at,the door practising,tranquil lays.
The echo,"of their singing,",how sad it sounds!
By the pitch of,the song one knows the,stops have been tightened.
To ease their minds they arrange,"their shawls and belts; Lowering their song, a",little while they pause.
“I should like to be those two flying,swallows Who are carrying clay to,nest in the eaves of your house.
” I drive my chariot up to,the Eastern Gate; From afar I see,the graveyard north of the Wall.
The white aspens how they,"murmur, murmur; Pines and cypresses",flank the broad paths.
Beneath lie men who,"died long ago; Black, black is",the long night that holds them.
Deep down beneath the,"Yellow Springs, Thousands of",years they lie without waking.
In infinite succession,"light and darkness shift, And years vanish",like the morning dew.
"Man’s life is like a sojourning,",His longevity lacks the firmness,of stone and metal.
For ever it has been,"that mourners in their turn were mourned, Saint","and Sage,--all alike are trapped."
Seeking by food to obtain,Immortality Many have,been the dupe of strange drugs.
Better far to drink,good wine And clothe our bodies,in robes of satin and silk.
The dead are gone and,with them we cannot,converse.
The living are,here and ought to have,our love.
Leaving the city-gate I look,ahead And see before me,only mounds and tombs.
The old graves are ploughed,"up into fields, The pines and cypresses",are hewn for timber.
In the white aspens sad,winds sing; Their long murmuring,kills my heart with grief.
I want to go,"home, to ride to my",village gate.
I want to go,"back, but there’s no",road back.
The years of a,lifetime do not,reach a hundred.
Yet they contain,a thousand years’,sorrow.
When days are short and,"the dull nights long, Why not take a",lamp and wander forth?
If you want to be happy,"you must do it now, There is no",waiting till an after-time.
The fool who’s loath to,spend the wealth he’s got Becomes the laughing-stock,of after ages.
It is true that Master,"Wang became immortal, But how can",_we_ hope to share his lot?
"Cold, cold the year draws to its","end, The crickets and grasshoppers",make a doleful chirping.
The chill wind,increases its,violence.
My wandering,love has no coat to,cover him.
He gave his embroidered furs,"to the Lady of Lo, But from me his",bedfellow he is quite estranged.
Sleeping alone in the depth,of the long night In a dream I thought,I saw the light of his face.
My dear one thought of our,"old joys together, He came in his",chariot and gave me the front reins.
I wanted so to prolong,"our play and laughter, To hold his",hand and go back with him in his coach.
"But, when he had come he",would not stay long Nor stop to go with me,to the Inner Chamber.
Truly without the falcon’s,wings to carry me How can I rival,the flying wind’s swiftness?
I go and lean at the,"gate and think of my grief, My falling",tears wet the double gates.
At the beginning of,"winter a cold spirit comes,","The North Wind blows--chill, chill."
"My sorrows being many, I","know the length of the nights, Raising my head I",look at the stars in their places.
On the fifteenth day the bright,"moon is full, On the twentieth",day the “toad and hare” wane.
” I put the letter away,"in the folds of my dress, For three years the",writing did not fade.
How with an undivided,heart I loved you I fear that you,will never know or guess.
"The bright moon, oh, how white","it shines, Shines down on the gauze",curtains of my bed.
Racked by sorrow,I toss and cannot,sleep.
Picking up,"my clothes, I wander",up and down.
My absent love says that he,"is happy, But I would rather he",said he was coming back.
Out in the courtyard,"I stand hesitating,",alone.
To whom,can I tell the sad,thoughts I think?
Staring before me I,enter my room again; Falling,tears wet my mantle and robe.
Autumn wind,rises: white,clouds fly.
Grass and,trees wither:,geese go south.
Orchids all,in bloom: chrysanthemums,smell sweet.
I think of my,lovely lady: I never,can forget.
Across the mid-stream white waves rise Flute and,drum keep time to sound of the rowers’ song; Amidst revel,"and feasting, sad thoughts come; Youth’s years how few!"
The sound,of her silk,skirt has stopped.
On the marble,pavement dust,grows.
Her empty,room is cold,and still.
Fallen leaves are,piled against,the doors.
Longing for that lovely,lady How can I bring my,aching heart to rest?
Is it,or isn’t,it?
I,stand,and look.
"The swish,",swish of,a silk skirt.
How slow,she,comes!
Our love was pure As the snow on the mountains:,White as a moon Between the clouds-- They’re telling me Your thoughts,are double That’s why I’ve come To break it off.
To-day we’ll,drink A cup,of wine.
To-morrow we’ll part Beside the Canal:,"Walking about Beside the Canal, Where its",branches divide East and west.
Alas,"and alas, And",again alas.
"So must a girl Cry when she’s married,","If she find not a man Of single heart, Who will",not leave her Till her hair is white.
Since our hair was plaited and,we became man and wife The love between,us was never broken by doubt.
So let us be merry,"this night together, Feasting and",playing while the good time lasts.
I suddenly remember the,distance that I must travel; I spring from,bed and look out to see the time.
The stars and planets are all,"grown dim in the sky; Long, long is",the road; I cannot stay.
I am going on,"service, away to the battle-ground, And I",do not know when I shall come back.
I hold your hand with only,"a deep sigh; Afterwards, tears--in the days",when we are parted.
With all your might enjoy the,"spring flowers, But do not forget",the time of our love and pride.
"Know that if I live, I will come","back again, And if I die, we will go",on thinking of each other.
The good time will never,"come back again: In a moment,--our parting",will be over.
Anxiously--we halt at the,"road-side, Hesitating--we embrace",where the fields begin.
The clouds above are floating,"across the sky: Swiftly, swiftly passing:",or blending together.
The waves in the wind lose,their fixed place And are rolled away each,to a corner of Heaven.
From now onwards--long,must be our,parting.
So let us,stop again for,a little while.
I wish I could ride on,the wings of the morning wind And go with,you right to your journey’s end.
I came ten thousand leagues Across,sandy deserts In the service of,"my Prince, To break the Hun tribes."
My way was,"blocked and barred, My arrows",and sword broken.
My armies had,"faded away, My",reputation had gone.
My old,mother is,long dead.
Although I want,to requite my Prince How,can I return?
My people have married me In a,far corner of Earth: Sent me away to a,"strange land, To the king of the Wu-sun."
"A tent is my house,",Of felt are my walls; Raw flesh my,food With mare’s milk to drink.
Always thinking,"of my own country, My",heart sad within.
Would I were a,yellow stork And could,fly to my old home!
"Solemn, solemn the",coachman gets ready to go:,"“Chiang, chiang” the harness bells ring."
At break of dawn I,must start on my long journey: At cock-crow,I must gird on my belt.
I turn back and look at,the empty room: For a moment I,almost think I see you there.
"One parting, but ten thousand","regrets: As I take my seat, my",heart is unquiet.
What shall,I do to tell,you all my thoughts?
How can,I let you know of all,my love?
Precious hairpins make,the head to shine And bright mirrors,can reflect beauty.
Fragrant herbs banish,evil smells And the scholar’s,harp has a clear note.
The man in the Book of Odes who,was given a quince Wanted to pay it,back with diamonds and rubies.
When I think of all the things you,"have done for me, How ashamed I am",to have done so little for you!
Although I know that it is,"a poor return, All I can give you is this",description of my feelings.
My poor body is,alas unworthy: I was ill when,first you brought me home.
Limp and weary,in the house-- Time passed and,I got no better.
We could hardly ever,see each other: I could not,serve you as I ought.
Then you received the Imperial,Mandate: You were ordered to go far,away to the City.
"Long, long must be our",parting: I was not destined,to tell you my thoughts.
I stood on tiptoe gazing,"into the distance, Interminably gazing",at the road that had taken you.
With thoughts of you my mind is,obsessed: In my dreams I see,the light of your face.
Now you are started on,your long journey Each day brings,you further from me.
Oh that I had,a bird’s wings And high flying,could follow you.
Long I sob and,long I cry: The tears fall,down and wet my skirt.
On the Eastern Way at the city of,"Lo-yang At the edge of the road peach-trees and plum-trees grow; On the two sides,--flower matched","by flower; Across the road,--leaf touching leaf."
A spring wind rises,from the north-east; Flowers and leaves,gently nod and sway.
Up the road somebody’s,"daughter comes Carrying a basket,",to gather silkworms’ food.
(_She sees the fruit trees in blossom,"and, forgetting about her silkworms, begins",to pluck the branches.
_) With her slender hand she,breaks a branch from the tree; The flowers,"fall, tossed and scattered in the wind."
"“Lovely lady, I never",did you harm; Why should you hate,me and do me injury?
Though in the autumn your,"leaves patter to the ground, When spring","comes, your gay bloom returns."
But in men’s lives when their,bright youth is spent Joy and love never,come back again.
"” When I was young, throughout",the hot season There were no carriages,driving about the roads.
People shut their doors and,lay down in the cool: Or if they went,"out, it was not to pay calls."
"Nowadays--ill-bred, ignorant","fellows, When they feel the heat,",make for a friend’s house.
"The unfortunate host,","when he hears someone coming Scowls and frowns,",but can think of no escape.
“There’s nothing for it but to rise,"and go to the door,” And in his comfortable",seat he groans and sighs.
The conversation,"does not end quickly: Prattling and babbling,",what a lot he says!
Only when one is almost,dead with fatigue He asks at last if,one isn’t finding him tiring.
(One’s arm is almost in half,with continual fanning: The sweat is pouring,down one’s neck in streams.
) Do not say that this is a,small matter: I consider the practice,a blot on our social life.
I therefore caution,all wise men That August visitors,should not be admitted.
I look up and see / his,curtains and bed: I look down and examine,/ his table and mat.
The things,are there / just as,before.
But the man,they belonged to / is,not there.
His spirit suddenly,/ has taken flight And left me behind,/ far away.
To whom shall,I look / on,whom rely?
My tears flow,/ in an endless,stream.
"“Yu, yu” / cry the wandering",deer As they carry fodder,/ to their young in the wood.
"Flap, flap / fly the birds",As they carry their little,ones / back to the nest.
I alone / am desolate,Dreading the days / of our long parting: My grieving,heart’s / settled pain No one else / can understand.
There is a saying,/ among people “Sorrow makes,us / grow old.
"” Alas,",alas / for,my white hairs!
All too,early,/ they have come!
"Long wailing, / long",sighing My thoughts are fixed on,my sage parent.
They say the,good / live long: Then why,was he / not spared?
My charioteer hastens,"to yoke my carriage, For I must go",on a journey far away.
“Where are you going,on your journey,far away?
” To the land,of Wu where my,enemies are.
But I must ride many,"thousand miles, Beyond the",Eastern Road that leads to Wu.
I want to take a skiff,"and cross these rivers, But alas for","me, where shall I find a boat?"
To sit idle is not my,desire: Gladly enough would I,go to my country’s aid.
In the North-west there is,"a floating cloud Stretched on high, like",a chariot’s canvas-awning.
Alas that I was born in,"these times, To be blown along like",a cloud puffed by the wind!
It has blown me away,"far to the South-east, On and on",till I came to Wu-hui.
Wu-hui is not my country:,Why should I go on staying,and staying here?
I will give it up and never,"speak of it again,-- This being abroad",and always living in dread.
I climb to the ridge of Pei,Mang Mountain And look down on,the city of Lo-yang.
In Lo-yang,how still it,is!
Palaces and,houses all burnt,to ashes.
Walls and fences all,"broken and gaping, Thorns and brambles",shooting up to the sky.
I do not see the,old old-men: I only see,the new young men.
"I turn aside, for the straight",road is lost: The fields are overgrown and,will never be ploughed again.
I have been away such,a long time That I do not,know which street is which.
How sad and,ugly the empty,moors are!
A thousand miles,without the smoke of a,chimney.
I think of the house,I lived in all those years: I am,heart-tied and cannot speak.
"“Wondrous was the wall-stone, Weirdly broken;","Burgh-steads bursten, Giants’ work tumbleth, Roofs are wrenched,","Towers totter, Bereft of rune-gates."
"Smoke is on the plaster,","Scarred the shower-burghs, Shorn and shattered,",By eld under-eaten.
Earth’s grip,haveth Wealders and,workmen.
” Our wandering,eyes are sated with,the dancer’s skill.
Our ears are,weary with the,sound of “kung” and “shang.
” Our host is silent,and sits doing nothing: All the guests go,on to places of amusement.
On long benches the,"sportsmen sit ranged Round a cleared room,",watching the fighting-cocks.
The gallant birds are,all in battle-trim: They raise their tails and,flap defiantly.
Their beating wings stir,the calm air: Their angry eyes,gleam with a red light.
"Where their beaks have struck, the fine feathers",are scattered: With their strong talons they,wound again and again.
Their long cries enter the,blue clouds; Their flapping wings,tirelessly beat and throb.
“Pray God the lamp-oil lasts a little,"longer, Then I shall not leave without",winning the match!
” In the Nine Provinces there is not room enough: I,"want to soar high among the clouds, And, far beyond the Eight Limits of the","compass, Cast my gaze across the unmeasured void."
The doors of Heaven,"swing open, The double gates",shine with a red light.
The Lord God lies at his western,lattice: And the lesser Spirits are together,in the eastern gallery.
They wash me in a bath,of rainbow-spray And gird me with a,belt of jasper and rubies.
I wander at my ease,gathering divine herbs: I bend down,and touch the scented flowers.
Wang-tzŭ gives me drugs,of long-life And Hsien-mēn,hands me strange potions.
By the partaking of food I evade,the rites of Death: My span is extended to the,enjoyment of life everlasting.
"Flap, flap, you curtain",in front of our,bed!
I hung you there,to screen us from,the light of day.
I brought you with me when I,left my father’s house; Now I am,taking you back with me again.
I will fold,you up and lay you,flat in your box.
Curtain--shall I,ever take you out,again?
When I was young I,learnt fencing And was better at,it than Crooked Castle.
My spirit was high,as the rolling clouds And my fame,resounded beyond the World.
I took my sword to,"the desert sands, I drank my",horse at the Nine Moors.
My flags and banners,"flapped in the wind, And nothing was heard",but the song of my drums.
"War and its travels have made me sad, And a",fierce anger burns within me: It’s thinking of how I’ve wasted,my time That makes this fury tear my heart.
I will cast,out Wisdom and,reject Learning.
My thoughts,shall wander in,the Great Void (_bis_).
Always repenting,of wrongs done Will never bring,my heart to rest.
I cast my hook in a single,stream; But my joy is as though I,possessed a Kingdom.
I loose my hair and,go singing; To the four frontiers,men join in my refrain.
This is the purport,of my song: “My thoughts shall wander,in the Great Void.
” A gentle wind fans,the calm night: A bright moon shines,on the high tower.
"A voice whispers, but no one","answers when I call: A shadow stirs, but",no one comes when I beckon.
The kitchen-man brings in,"a dish of lentils: Wine is there,",but I do not fill my cup.
Contentment with poverty,is Fortune’s best gift: Riches and Honour are,the handmaids of Disaster.
Though gold and gems by the,"world are sought and prized, To me they",seem no more than weeds or chaff.
How sad it is,to be a,woman!
Nothing,on earth is held,so cheap.
Boys stand leaning,at the door Like Gods fallen,out of Heaven.
Their hearts brave the Four,"Oceans, The wind and dust of",a thousand miles.
No one is glad when,a girl is born: By _her_ the,family sets no store.
"When she grows up, she hides",in her room Afraid to look,a man in the face.
No one cries when,she leaves her home-- Sudden,as clouds when the rain stops.
She bows her head and composes,"her face, Her teeth are pressed on her red lips:",She bows and kneels countless times.
She must humble,herself even to,the servants.
_His_ love is distant as,"the stars in Heaven, Yet the sunflower",bends toward the sun.
Their hearts more sundered than water,and fire-- A hundred evils,are heaped upon her.
Her face will follow,the years’ changes: Her lord,will find new pleasures.
They that were once like,substance and shadow Are now,as far as Hu from Ch’in.
Yet Hu and Ch’in shall sooner,meet Than they whose parting is like,Ts’an and Ch’ēn.
When I was young I played with,a soft brush And was passionately,devoted to reading all sorts of books.
But then the arrows,began singing at,the frontier.
And a winged summons,came flying to the,City.
Although arms were,"not my profession, I had",once read Jang-Chū’s war-book.
I shouted aloud and my cries,rent the air: I felt as though Tung Wu were,already annihilated.
The scholar’s knife cuts best at its,first use And my dreams hurried on to,the completion of my plan.
I wanted at a stroke to,"clear the Yang-tze and Hsiang, And at a glance to",quell the Tibetans and Hu.
"When my task was done, I should not accept","a barony, But refusing with a bow, retire",to a cottage in the country.
"Flap, flap, the captive bird",in the cage Beating its wings,against the four corners.
"Depressed, depressed the scholar","in the narrow street: Clasping a shadow,",he dwells in an empty house.
"When he goes out, there is nowhere",for him to go: Bunches and brambles,block up his path.
"He composes a memorial,","but it is rejected and unread, He is left stranded,",like a fish in a dry pond.
Without--he has not a single farthing,of salary: Within--there is not a peck,of grain in his larder.
His relations upbraid him,for his lack of success: His friends and callers,daily decrease in number.
I once hoped to pluck,"the fruits of life: But now alas,",they are all withered and dry.
"Though one drinks at a river, one cannot","drink more than a bellyful; Enough is good, but",there is no use in satiety.
The bird in a forest can,"perch but on one bough, And this should",be the wise man’s pattern.
At Pei-mang how they rise,"to Heaven, Those high mounds, four",or five in the fields!
What men lie,buried under,these tombs?
All of,them were Lords,of the Han world.
"When the dynasty was falling,","tumult and disorder arose, Thieves and",robbers roamed like wild beasts.
Of earth they have carried away,"more than one handful, They have gone into",vaults and opened the secret doors.
Over everything the,tangled thorns are growing: A herd-boy pushes,through them up the path.
Down in the thorns rabbits,have made their burrows: The weeds and thistles,will never be cleared away.
Over the tombs the ploughshare,will be driven And peasants will have their,fields and orchards there.
They that were once lords of a,thousand hosts Are now become the dust,of the hills and ridges.
"” When I was alive, I wandered in",the streets of the Capital: Now that I am,"dead, I am left to lie in the fields."
In the morning I drove,out from the High Hall: In the evening I,lodged beneath the Yellow Springs.
When the white sun had sunk in,the Western Chasm I hung up my chariot,and rested my four horses.
"Now, even the mighty",Maker of All Could not bring the,life back to my limbs.
Shape and substance day,by day will vanish: Hair and teeth will,gradually fall away.
Forever from of,old men have been so: And none,born can escape this thing.
"Living in retirement beyond the World,","Silently enjoying isolation, I pull the rope of my door",tighter And stuff my window with roots and ferns.
My spirit is tuned to,the Spring-season: At the fall of the,year there is autumn in my heart.
Thus imitating,cosmic changes My cottage becomes,a Universe.
"Shady, shady the wood",in front of the Hall: At midsummer,full of calm shadows.
The south wind follows summer’s,train: With its eddying-puffs it blows,open my coat.
I am free from,ties and can live a life of,retirement.
When I rise,"from sleep, I play with",books and harp.
The lettuce in the garden,still grows moist: Of last year’s grain there is,always plenty left.
Self-support should maintain strict,limits: More than enough,is not what I want.
I grind millet and make,"good wine: When the wine is heated,",I pour it out for myself.
My little children are,"playing at my side, Learning to","talk, they babble unformed sounds."
These things have made me happy,again And I forget my,lost cap of office.
"Distant, distant I gaze at the white",clouds: With a deep yearning I think of the,Sages of Antiquity.
In the quiet of the morning,I heard a knock at my door: I threw on my,clothes and opened it myself.
I asked who it was who had come so,"early to see me: He said he was a peasant,",coming with good intent.
He brought a present of,"wine and rice-soup, Believing that I had",fallen on evil days.
“You live in rags under a,thatched roof And seem to have no,desire for a better lot.
The rest of mankind have,"all the same ambitions: You, too, must",learn to wallow in their mire.
"” “Old man, I am impressed","by what you say, But my soul is",not fashioned like other men’s.
To drive in their rut I might,perhaps learn: To be untrue to myself,could only lead to muddle.
Let us drink and enjoy together,the wine you have brought: For my course is set and,cannot now be altered.
” A long time ago I went,"on a journey, Right to the corner",Of the Eastern Ocean.
The road there Was,"long and winding, And stormy",waves Barred my path.
What made me,Go this,way?
Hunger drove,me Into,the World.
I tried hard To fill,my belly: And even a,little Seemed a lot.
But this was clearly,"A bad bargain, So I went",home And lived in idleness.
"High and low, wise and","simple, all busily hoard",up the moments of life.
Therefore I have to the uttermost exposed the,"bitterness both of Substance and Shadow, and have made Spirit show how,","by following Nature, we may dissolve this bitterness."
Heaven and Earth exist,for ever: Mountains and rivers,never change.
But herbs and trees in perpetual rotation,"Are renovated and withered by the dews and frosts: And Man the wise,",Man the divine-- Shall he alone escape this law?
Fortuitously appearing,for a moment in the World He suddenly,"departs, never to return."
How can he know that,the friends he has left Are missing,him and thinking of him?
Only the things that,he used remain; They look upon,them and their tears flow.
Me no magical,"arts can save, Though you may hope",for a wizard’s aid.
I beg you listen,to this advice-- When you can get,"wine, be sure to drink it."
There is,no way to preserve,life.
Drugs of,Immortality,are instruments of folly.
I would gladly wander,"in Paradise, But it is far",away and there is no road.
Since the day that I,was joined to you We have shared,all our joys and pains.
"While you rested in the shade,",I left you a while: But till the end,we shall be together.
Our joint existence,is impermanent: Sadly together,we shall slip away.
That when the body decays Fame,should also go Is a thought,"unendurable, burning the heart."
Let us strive and,labour while yet we may To,do some deed that men will praise.
Wine may in truth dispel,"our sorrow, But how compare",it with lasting Fame?
God can only set,in motion: He cannot control,the things he has made.
"Man, the second","of the Three Orders, Owes his",precedence to Me.
"Though I am different from you, We were",born involved in one another: Nor by any means can we,escape The intimate sharing of good and ill.
The Three,Emperors were saintly,"men, Yet to-day--where are they?"
P’ēng lived to a,"great age, Yet he went at last, when",he longed to stay.
"And late or soon,",all go: Wise and simple,have no reprieve.
Wine may bring,"forgetfulness, But does",it not hasten old-age?
If you set your heart,"on noble deeds, How do you",know that any will praise you?
Chill and harsh the year draws,to its close: In my cotton dress,I seek sunlight on the porch.
In the southern orchard,all the leaves are gone: In the north,garden rotting boughs lie heaped.
I empty my cup and,drink it down to the dregs: I look towards,"the kitchen, but no smoke rises."
Poems and books lie piled beside,my chair: But the light is going and I shall,not have time to read them.
My life here is not like the,"Agony in Ch’ēn, But often I",have to bear bitter reproaches.
"Let me then remember, to","calm my heart’s distress, That the Sages",of old were often in like case.
"White hair covers my temples, I am","wrinkled and seared beyond repair, And though I have","got five sons, They all hate paper and brush."
A-shu is eighteen: For,laziness there is,none like him.
A-hsüan does his,"best, But really",loathes the Fine Arts.
But,does not,know “six” from “seven.
” T’ung-tzŭ in his ninth,year Is only concerned,with things to eat.
If Heaven treats,"me like this, What can I",do but fill my cup?
I built my hut in a zone,"of human habitation, Yet near me there",sounds no noise of horse or coach.
Would you know,how that is,possible?
A heart that is,distant creates a,wilderness round it.
I pluck chrysanthemums under,"the eastern hedge, Then gaze long at the",distant summer hills.
The mountain air is fresh at,the dusk of day: The flying birds,two by two return.
In these things there lies a,"deep meaning; Yet when we would express it,",words suddenly fail us.
My old desire to live in the,Southern Village Was not because I had taken,a fancy to the house.
But I heard it was a place,of simple-minded men With whom it were a joy to,spend the mornings and evenings.
Many years I had longed,to settle here: Now at last I have,managed to move house.
I do not mind if my cottage,is rather small So long as there’s room enough,for bed and mat.
Often and often the,neighbours come to see me And with brave words,discuss the things of old.
Rare writings we read together,and praise: Doubtful meanings we examine,together and settle.
"When I was young, I was out",of tune with the herd: My only love,was for the hills and mountains.
Unwitting I fell into,the Web of the World’s dust And was not,free until my thirtieth year.
The migrant bird longs,for the old wood: The fish in the tank thinks,of its native pool.
I had rescued from wildness a patch,"of the Southern Moor And, still rustic, I",returned to field and garden.
My ground covers no more than,ten acres: My thatched cottage,has eight or nine rooms.
Elms and willows cluster,by the eaves: Peach trees and plum trees,grow before the Hall.
"Hazy, hazy",the distant hamlets,of men.
"Steady the smoke of the half-deserted village,","A dog barks somewhere in the deep lanes, A cock crows at",the top of the mulberry tree.
At gate and courtyard--no murmur,of the World’s dust: In the empty,rooms--leisure and deep stillness.
Long I lived checked by the,bars of a cage: Now I have turned again,to Nature and Freedom.
In the month of June the,grass grows high And round my cottage,thick-leaved branches sway.
There is not a bird but delights,in the place where it rests: And I,too--love my thatched cottage.
I have done,my ploughing: I,have sown my seed.
Again I have,time to sit and,read my books.
In the narrow lane there are,no deep ruts: Often my friends’,carriages turn back.
In high spirits I pour,out my spring wine And pluck the,lettuce growing in my garden.
A gentle rain comes stealing,up from the east And a sweet wind bears,it company.
My thoughts float idly over the story,of King Chou My eyes wander over the,pictures of Hills and Seas.
At a single,glance I survey the whole,Universe.
He will never be,"happy, whom such pleasures",fail to please!
"The lingering clouds, rolling,","rolling, And the settled rain, dripping, dripping,",In the Eight Directions--the same dusk.
The level,lands--one great,river.
"Wine I have, wine I",have: Idly I drink at the,eastern window.
Longingly--I think,"of my friends, But neither",boat nor carriage comes.
Swiftly,"the years, beyond",recall.
Solemn the stillness,of this fair,morning.
I will clothe myself,in spring-clothing And visit the,slopes of the Eastern Hill.
By the mountain-stream a,"mist hovers, Hovers a moment,",then scatters.
There comes a wind blowing,from the south That brushes the,fields of new corn.
I collected,together All,my friends.
Loud talk And simple feasting:,"Discussion of philosophy,",Investigation of subtleties.
Tongues loosened,And minds at,one.
Hearts refreshed,By discharge of,emotion!
High rises the,Eastern Peak Soaring up,to the blue sky.
Among the rocks--an,"empty hollow, Secret,","still, mysterious!"
"Uncarved and unhewn,",Screened by nature with a,roof of clouds.
"Times and Seasons, what",things are you Bringing to my,life ceaseless change?
I will lodge for ever,in this hollow Where Springs,and Autumns unheeded pass.
All night I could,not sleep Because of the,moonlight on my bed.
I kept on hearing,"a voice calling: Out of Nowhere,",Nothing answered “yes.
” I will carry my coat and,not put on my belt; With unpainted eyebrows,I will stand at the front window.
My tiresome petticoat,"keeps on flapping about; If it opens a little,",I shall blame the spring wind.
I heard my love was,going to Yang-chou And went with,him as far as Ch’u-shan.
For a moment when you held,me fast in your outstretched arms I thought the river,stood still and did not flow.
I have brought my pillow and am,"lying at the northern window, So come to",me and play with me awhile.
With so much quarrelling,and so few kisses How long do you,think our love can last?
Her door opened on the white water Close,by the side of the timber bridge: That’s where the little lady,lived All alone without a lover.
"Green rushes with red shoots, Long leaves",bending to the wind-- You and I in the same boat,Plucking rushes at the Five Lakes.
We started at dawn from,the orchid-island: We rested under,the elms till noon.
You and I plucking,rushes Had not plucked a handful,when night came!
“Seeing the plum-tree I thought of the Western,Island And I plucked a branch to send,to the North Country.
I put on my dress of,apricot-yellow silk And bound up my hair,black as the crow’s wing.
But which is the road,that leads to the Western,Island?
I’ll ask the man at,the ferry by the,Bridge of Boats.
But the sun is sinking and the,orioles flying home: And the wind is blowing,and sighing in the walnut-tree.
I’ll stand under the tree just,beside the gate: I’ll stand by the door,and show off my enamelled hair-pins.
"” She’s opened the gate, but",her lover has not come: She’s gone out,at the gate to pluck red lotus.
As she plucks the lotus on the,"southern dyke in autumn, The lotus flowers",stand higher than a man’s head.
She bends down--and plays with,"the lotus seeds, The lotus",seeds are green like the lake-water.
She gathers the flowers and,puts them into her gown-- The lotus-bud,that is red all through.
"She thinks of her lover, her lover",that does not come: She looks up and sees the wild geese flying--,The Western Island is full of wild geese.
To look for her,lover she climbs,the Blue Tower.
The tower is high: she,"looks, but cannot see: All day she leans",on the balcony rails.
The rail is,twisted into,a twelve-fold pattern.
She lets fall her,hand white like the colour,of jade.
"She rolls up the awning,","she sees the wide sky, And the sea-water",waving its vacant blue.
“The sea shall carry my dreams far,"away, So that you shall be sorry",at last for my sorrow.
If the South wind--only knew my,thoughts It would blow my dreams till they got,to the Western Island.
” I was brought up under,the Stone Castle: My window opened,on to the castle tower.
In the castle were,beautiful young men Who waved to me as,they went in and out.
Chiang-nan is a glorious,"and beautiful land, And Chin-ling an",exalted and kingly province!
The green canals of the city,stretch on and on And its high towers,stretch up and up.
Flying gables lean over,the bridle-road: Drooping willows cover,the Royal Aqueduct.
Shrill flutes sing by the coach’s,"awning, And reiterated",drums bang near its painted wheels.
The names of the,deserving shall be carved,on the Cloud Terrace.
And for those who,have done valiantly,rich reward awaits.
Now late I follow Time’s,Necessity: Mounting a barricade,I pacify remote tribes.
Discarding my sash I don a,coat of rhinoceros-skin: Rolling up my,skirts I shoulder a black bow.
Even at the very,start my strength fails: What will become of me,before it’s all over?
Red hills lie athwart us,"as a menace in the west, And fiery",mountains glare terrible in the south.
"The body burns, the","head aches and throbs: If a bird light here, its",soul forthwith departs.
Warm springs Pour from,cloudy pools And hot smoke issues,between the rocks.
The sun and moon are,perpetually obscured: The,rain and dew never stay dry.
There are red serpents,"a hundred feet long, And black snakes",ten girths round.
The sand-spitters shoot their poison at,the sunbeams: The flying insects are,ill with the shifting glare.
The hungry monkeys dare not,come down to eat: The morning birds,dare not set out to fly.
At the Ching river many die,of poison: Crossing the Lu one is lucky,if one is only ill.
Our living feet,walk on dead ground: Our high,wills surmount the snares of Fate.
The Spear-boat General,got but little honour: The,Wave-subduer met with scant reward.
If our Prince still grudges the things,"that are easy to give, Can he hope that his",soldiers will give what is hardest to give?
“I heard at night your,long sighs And knew that you,were thinking of me.
"” As she spoke, the doors of Heaven",opened And our souls conversed,and I saw her face.
She set me a,pillow to rest on And,she brought me meat and drink.
"I stood beside her where she lay, But suddenly","woke and she was not there: And none knew how my soul was torn, How",the tears fell surging over my breast.
In the high trees--many doleful,winds: The ocean waters--lashed,into waves.
If the sharp sword be not,"in your hand, How can you hope your friends",will remain many?
Do you not,see that sparrow,on the fence?
Seeing the hawk,it casts itself,into the snare.
The fowler to catch the,sparrow is delighted: The Young Man to,see the sparrow is grieved.
He takes his sword and,cuts through the netting: The yellow sparrow,"flies away, away."
"Away, away, up",to the blue sky And down again,to thank the Young Man.
A beautiful place,is the town of Lo-yang: The big streets,are full of spring light.
The lads go driving out with harps,in their hands: The mulberry girls go out,to the fields with their baskets.
Golden whips,glint at the,horses’ flanks.
Gauze sleeves,brush the green,boughs.
"Racing dawn, the carriages","come home,-- And the girls with their high baskets",full of fruit.
My bed is so empty that,"I keep on waking up: As the cold increases,",the night-wind begins to blow.
"It rustles the curtains, making",a noise like the sea: Oh that those were waves,which could carry me back to you!
"Entering the Hall, she","meets the new wife: Leaving the gate, she runs",into her former husband.
Words stick: she does not manage to,say anything: She presses her hands,together and hesitates.
Agitates moon-like fan--sheds pearl-like tears-- Realizes,she loves him just as much as ever: That her present,pain will never come to an end.
Who says That it’s by my,"desire, This separation,",this living so far from you?
My dress still smells of the,lavender you gave: My hand still holds,the letter that you sent.
Round my waist I wear,a double sash: I dream that it binds us,both with a same-heart knot.
Did not you know that people,"hide their love, Like a flower that seems too",precious to be picked?
Of marsh-mallows my,"boat is made, The",ropes are lily-roots.
The pole-star is,athwart the sky: The,moon sinks low.
It’s at,the ferry I’m plucking,lilies.
But it might be the Yellow River--,"So afraid you seem of the wind and waves, So long",you tarry at the crossing.
The road that I came by mounts,eight thousand feet: The river that I,crossed hangs a hundred fathoms.
The brambles,so thick that in summer,one cannot pass!
The snow so,high that in winter,one cannot climb!
With branches that interlace,Lung Valley is dark: Against cliffs that tower,one’s voice beats and echoes.
"I turn my head, and it",seems only a dream That I ever,lived in the streets of Hsien-yang.
The evening river is level,and motionless-- The spring colours,just open to their full.
Suddenly a wave carries,the moon away And the tidal water,comes with its freight of stars.
"Kao Huan, that",son of a mouse Dared,to attack King Pi.
But at the first stroke of sword,"and bow, The aggressor’s plot",recoiled on himself.
Tchirek River Lies under the,Dark Mountains: Where the sky is like the sides of a,tent Stretched down over the Great Steppe.
"The sky is gray, gray: And the","steppe wide, wide: Over grass that the wind has battered",low Sheep and oxen roam.
Business men boast of their skill,and cunning But in philosophy they,are like little children.
Bragging to each other of successful,depredations They neglect to consider the,ultimate fate of the body.
"“Tell me now, what should a","man want But to sit alone, sipping",his cup of wine?
Then I could jog through a,"happy five-score years And, at the","end, need no Paradise."
"These days, continually","fuddled with drink, I fail to satisfy",the appetites of the soul.
But seeing men all,"behaving like drunkards, How can I",alone remain sober?
"“His subjects were always original,","but his poems are seldom worth quoting,” is",a Chinese opinion of him.
"I loved you dearly,","Stone Fish Lake, With your rock-island shaped",like a swimming fish!
On the fish’s back is,"the Wine-cup Hollow And round the fish,--the flowing",waters of the Lake.
The boys on the shore sent little,"wooden ships, Each made to carry a",single cup of wine.
The island-drinkers emptied,the liquor-boats And set their sails and,sent them back for more.
On the shores of the Lake were,jutting slabs of rock And under the rocks,there flowed an icy stream.
"Heated with wine, to rinse",our mouths and hands In those cold waters,was a joy beyond compare!
Of gold and jewels I,have not any need; For Caps and,Coaches I do not care at all.
But I wish I could sit on the,rocky banks of the Lake For ever and ever,staring at the Stone Fish.
Above the lake are deep,"mountain valleys, And men dwelling",whose hearts are without guile.
"Gay like children, they swarm",to the tops of the trees; And run to,the water to catch bream and trout.
Their pleasures are the same as,those of beasts and birds; They put no restraint,either on body or mind.
Far I have wandered throughout,the Nine Lands; Wherever I went such,manners had disappeared.
I find myself standing and,"wondering, perplexed, Whether Saints and Sages",have really done us good.
The hills and rivers,of the lowland country You,have made your battle-ground.
How do you suppose,the people who live there Will,procure “firewood and hay”?
Do not let me hear you talking together,About titles and promotions; For a single general’s,reputation Is made out of ten thousand corpses.
"Families, when a",child is born Want it to,be intelligent.
"I, through intelligence, Having","wrecked my whole life, Only hope the baby will",prove Ignorant and stupid.
Then he will crown a tranquil,life By becoming a Cabinet,Minister.
An old man selling,charms in a cranny of,the town wall.
He writes out spells,to bless the silkworms and spells,to protect the corn.
With the money he,gets each day he only,buys wine.
But he does not worry,"when his legs get wobbly, For he",has a boy to lean on.
Away and away,I sail in my light boat; My heart leaps with,a great gust of joy.
Through the leafless branches I,see the temple in the wood; Over the dwindling,stream the stone bridge towers.
Down the grassy lanes sheep,and oxen pass; In the misty,village cranes and magpies cry.
Back in my home I drink,a cup of wine And need not fear,the greed of the evening wind.
In the southern village,the boy who minds the ox With his naked,feet stands on the ox’s back.
Through the hole in his coat,the river wind blows; Through his broken,hat the mountain rain pours.
On the long dyke he seemed to,be far away; In the narrow lane,suddenly we were face to face.
The boy is home and the,ox is back in its stall; And a dark smoke,oozes through the thatched roof.
"Of Spring water,--thirty",or forty miles: In the,"evening sunlight,--three or four houses."
Youths and boys minding,geese and ducks: Women and girls tending,mulberries and hemp.
"The place,--remote: their coats","and scarves old: The year,--fruitful: their",talk and laughter gay.
The old wanderer moors,his flat boat And staggers up the bank to,pluck wistaria flowers.
The little cart,jolting and banging through the,yellow haze of dusk.
The man pushing,behind: the woman,pulling in front.
They have left the city,and do not know where,to go.
"“Green, green, those elm-tree leaves: _they_ will cure","my hunger, If only we could find some quiet",place and sup on them together.
” The wind has flattened the yellow,mother-wort: Above it in the distance they,see the walls of a house.
“_There_ surely must be,people living who’ll give you,something to eat.
"” They tap at the door, but","no one comes: they look in, but",the kitchen is empty.
They stand hesitating,in the lonely road and their,tears fall like rain.
Since I left my home,to seek official state Seven,years I have lived in Ch’ang-an.
What,have I,gained?
We have roamed on horseback under,the flowering trees; We have walked in the snow,and warmed our hearts with wine.
We have met and parted at,the Western Gate And neither of us,bothered to put on Cap or Belt.
We did not go up together,for Examination; We were not serving in,the same Department of State.
The bond that joined us,lay deeper than outward things; The rivers,of our souls spring from the same well!
I look down on,the Twelve City Streets:-- Red dust,flanked by green trees!
Coaches and horsemen alone,fill my eyes; I do not see whom my,heart longs to see.
Of all that walk on,the North-South Road There is not one that I care,for more than the rest!
At the palace doors the smell of,meat and wine; On the road the bones of,one who was frozen to death.
"Ten leagues riding, always",facing to the North; The cold wind,almost blew off my ears.
I waited for the bell outside,the Five Gates; I waited for the summons,within the Triple Hall.
My hair and beard were frozen,and covered with icicles; My coat,and robe--chilly like water.
At the western window I,paused from writing rescripts; The pines and bamboos,were all buried in stillness.
The moon rose and a,"calm wind came; Suddenly, it was like",an evening in the hills.
"And so, as I dozed, I dreamed",of the South West And thought I was staying,at the Hsien-yu Temple.
When I woke and heard the dripping,of the Palace clock I still thought it the,murmur of a mountain stream.
The snow has,gone from Chung-nan; spring is,almost come.
Lovely in the distance,"its blue colours, against the",brown of the streets.
"A thousand coaches, ten thousand",horsemen pass down the Nine Roads; Turns his head,"and looks at the mountains,--not one man!"
We talked together,in the Yung-shou Temple; We parted to the,north of the Hsin-ch’ang dyke.
Going home--I shed a,"few tears, Grieving about","things,--not sorry for you."
"Long, long the road to",Lan-t’ien; You said yourself you would,not be able to write.
Reckoning up your halts,for eating and sleeping-- By this time,you’ve crossed the Shang mountains.
Last night the clouds scattered,"away; A thousand leagues, the",same moonlight scene.
"When dawn came, I dreamt I saw",your face; It must have been that you,were thinking of me.
"In my dream, I thought I",held your hand And asked you to tell,me what your thoughts were.
And _you_ said: “I miss you,"bitterly, But there’s no one here to",send to you with a letter.
"” When I awoke, before","I had time to speak, A knocking on","the door sounded “Doong, doong!"
” They came and told me a,messenger from Shang-chou Had brought a,"letter,--a single scroll from you!"
Up from my pillow I,"suddenly sprang out of bed, And","threw you my clothes, all topsy-turvy."
I undid the knot and,saw the letter within; A single sheet,with thirteen lines of writing.
At the top it told the sorrows,of an exile’s heart; At the bottom it described,the pains of separation.
The sorrows and pains took,up so much space There was no room left,to talk about the weather!
But you said that when you wrote You were staying for the,"night to the east of Shang-chou; Sitting alone, lighted by a solitary",candle Lodging in the mountain hostel of Yang-Ch’ēng.
Night was late when you,"finished writing, The mountain moon",was slanting towards the west.
What is it,lies aslant across,the moon?
A single tree of purple _paulovnia_ flowers--,Paulovnia flowers just on the point of falling Are a,symbol to express “thinking of an absent friend.
” Lovingly--you wrote on the back,"side, To send in the letter, your “Poem of",the Paulovnia Flower.
” The Poem of the Paulovnia,Flower has eight rhymes; Yet these eight couplets have,cast a spell on my heart.
They have taken hold of this,"morning’s thoughts And carried them to yours, the",night you wrote your letter.
The whole poem,I read three times; Each verse ten,times I recite.
So precious to me are the,fourscore words That each letter changes,into a bar of gold!
When the yellow bird’s note was almost stopped; And half,"formed the green plum’s fruit; Sitting and grieving that spring things were over,",I rose and entered the Eastern Garden’s gate.
I carried my cup and was,dully drinking alone: Suddenly I,heard a knocking sound at the door.
"Dwelling secluded, I was","glad that someone had come; How much the more,",when I saw it was Ch’ēn Hsiung!
"At ease and leisure,--all day","we talked; Crowding and jostling,--the",feelings of many years.
How great a,thing is a single,cup of wine!
For it makes us,tell the story of,our whole lives.
When I was almost forty,I had a daughter whose name,was Golden Bells.
Now it is just a year since,she was born; She is learning to,sit and cannot yet talk.
"Ashamed,--to find that I have",not a sage’s heart: I cannot resist,vulgar thoughts and feelings.
Henceforward I am,"tied to things outside myself: My only reward,--the",pleasure I am getting now.
If I am spared the grief of,"her dying young, Then I shall have the",trouble of getting her married.
My plan for retiring,and going back to the hills Must now,be postponed for fifteen years!
"Ruined and ill,--a man","of two score; Pretty and guileless,--a",girl of three.
"Not a boy,--but, still better","than nothing: To soothe one’s feeling,--from",time to time a kiss!
"There came a day,--they suddenly",took her from me; Her soul’s shadow,wandered I know not where.
"At last, by thinking of the time","before she was born, By thought and reason",I drove the pain away.
"Since my heart forgot her, many",days have passed And three times winter,has changed to spring.
"This morning, for a little,","the old grief came back, Because, in the","road, I met her foster-nurse."
"Sad, sad--lean with long illness;","Monotonous, monotonous--days",and nights pass.
The summer trees have clad,themselves in shade; The autumn “lan” already,houses the dew.
The eggs that lay in the,nest when I took to bed Have changed into little,birds and flown away.
The worm that then lay hidden,in its hole Has hatched into a cricket,sitting on the tree.
The Four Seasons go on for,ever and ever: In all Nature nothing stops,to rest Even for a moment.
Only the sick,man’s heart Deep down still aches,as of old!
"Deep the waters of the Black Pool,",coloured like ink; They say a Holy Dragon,"lives there, whom men have never seen."
Beside the Pool they have built a shrine; the authorities,have established a ritual; A dragon by itself remains,"a dragon, but men can make it a god."
"Prosperity and disaster, rain and drought,",plagues and pestilences-- By the village people were all,regarded as the Sacred Dragon’s doing.
They all made offerings of sucking-pig and poured,libations of wine; The morning prayers and evening gifts,"depended on a “medium’s” advice When the dragon comes, ah!"
The wind stirs,and sighs Paper,"money thrown, ah!"
Silk,umbrellas,waved.
When the,"dragon goes,",ah!
The,wind,also--still.
The cups,and vessels,are cold.
Meats lie stacked on the rocks,of the Pool’s shore; Wine flows on the grass,in front of the shrine.
"I do not know, of all those offerings,",how much the Dragon eats; But the mice of the woods and the foxes,of the hills are continually drunk and sated.
Why are,the foxes,so lucky?
"What have the sucking-pigs done,","That year by year _they_ should be killed,",merely to glut the foxes?
That the foxes are robbing the Sacred,"Dragon and eating His sucking-pig, Beneath the nine-fold depths","of His pool, does He know or not?"
There came an officer,knocking by night at my door-- In a,loud voice demanding grain-tribute.
My house-servants dared not wait till,"the morning, But brought candles",and set them on the barn-floor.
"Passed through the sieve,","clean-washed as pearls, A whole cart-load, thirty",bushels of grain.
But still they cry that it is,not paid in full: With whips and curses,they goad my servants and boys.
"Once, in error, I entered",public life; I am inwardly ashamed,that my talents were not sufficient.
In succession I,occupied four official posts; For,"doing nothing,--ten years’ salary!"
Often have I heard that,saying of ancient men That “good and ill,follow in an endless chain.
” And to-day it ought to set,my heart at rest To return to others,the corn in my great barn.
In the land of Tao-chou Many,of the people are dwarfs; The tallest of them,never grow to more than three feet.
They were sold in the market as dwarf,slaves and yearly sent to Court; Described as “an offering,of natural products from the land of Tao-chou.
” A strange “offering of natural products”;,I never heard of one yet That parted men from,"those they loved, never to meet again!"
Old men--weeping for their,grandsons; mothers for,their children!
One day--Yang Ch’ēng came to govern,the land; He refused to send up dwarf slaves,in spite of incessant mandates.
” The Emperor’s heart was deeply,moved and he sealed and sent a scroll “The yearly tribute,of dwarfish slaves is henceforth annulled.
” The people of,"Tao-chou, Old ones and young ones,",how great their joy!
Father with son and brother with,brother henceforward kept together; From that day,for ever more they lived as free men.
The people,of Tao-chou Still enjoy,this gift.
And even now when,they speak of the Governor,Tears start to their eyes.
And lest their children and their children’s children,"should forget the Governor’s name, When boys are born the",syllable “Yang” is often used in their forename.
Of cord and cassia-wood,is the harp compounded: Within it,lie ancient melodies.
Ancient melodies--weak and,"savourless, Not appealing",to present men’s taste.
Light and colour are,faded from the jade stops: Dust has,covered the rose-red strings.
Decay and ruin came,"to it long ago, But the sound that",is left is still cold and clear.
I do not refuse to play,"it, if you want me to: But even if","I play, people will not listen."
How did it come,to be neglected,so?
Because of,the Ch’iang flute and the,Ch’in flageolet.
The singers have hushed their,notes of clear song: The red sleeves of the,dancers are motionless.
"Hugging his lute, the old",harper of Chao Rocks and sways as he,touches the five chords.
The loud notes swell and,"scatter abroad: “Sa, sa,” like",wind blowing the rain.
The soft notes dying,"almost to nothing: “Ch’ieh, ch’ieh,” like the",voice of ghosts talking.
Now as glad as the magpie’s,lucky song: Again bitter as the,gibbon’s ominous cry.
And those who sit and listen,to the tune he plays Of soul and body,lose the mastery.
And those who pass that way as,"he plays the tune, Suddenly stop",and cannot raise their feet.
"Alas, alas that the",ears of common men Should love the,modern and not love the old.
Thus it is that the harp in,the green window Day by day is,covered deeper with dust.
In the Royal City,"spring is almost over: Tinkle, tinkle--the",coaches and horsemen pass.
We tell each other “This is the,peony season”: And follow with the,crowd that goes to the Flower Market.
“Cheap and dear--no uniform price:,The cost of the plant depends on the,number of blossoms.
"For the fine flower,--a hundred",pieces of damask: For the cheap,"flower,--five bits of silk."
Above is spread an awning,to protect them: Around is woven a,wattle-fence to screen them.
If you sprinkle water and,"cover the roots with mud, When they are transplanted,",they will not lose their beauty.
” Each household thoughtlessly,"follows the custom, Man by man, no",one realizing.
There happened to be,an old farm labourer Who,came by chance that way.
He bowed his head and sighed,a deep sigh: But this sigh,nobody understood.
"He was thinking, “A cluster",of deep-red flowers Would pay the taxes of,ten poor houses.
” Tartars,"led in chains, Tartars",led in chains!
"Their ears pierced, their",faces bruised--they are driven,into the land of Ch’in.
The Son of Heaven,took pity on them and would not,have them slain.
A petty officer in a yellow coat,took down their names and surnames: They were led from the city,of Ch’ang-an under escort of an armed guard.
Their bodies were covered,"with the wounds of arrows, their",bones stood out from their cheeks.
They had grown so,weak they could only march,a single stage a day.
In the morning they must satisfy hunger,and thirst with neither plate nor cup: At night they must lie in,their dirt and rags on beds that stank with filth.
Suddenly they came to the,Yangtze River and remembered the,waters of Chiao.
With lowered hands,and levelled voices they sobbed,a muffled song.
Then one Tartar lifted up his,"voice and spoke to the other Tartars, “_Your_ sorrows are none",at all compared with _my_ sorrows.
” Those that were with him in the same,band asked to hear his tale: As he tried to speak,the words were choked by anger.
He told them,“I was born and bred in the town,of Liang-yüan.
In the frontier wars,of Ta-li I fell into,the Tartars’ hands.
Since the days the Tartars took me alive,forty years have passed: They put me into a coat,of skins tied with a belt of rope.
Only on the first,of the first month might I wear,my Chinese dress.
As I put on my,"coat and arranged my cap,",how fast the tears flowed!
I made in my heart a secret vow I,would find a way home: I hid my plan from my Tartar wife,and the children she had borne me in the land.
"I thought to myself, ‘It is well for me that","my limbs are still strong,’ And yet, being old, in my heart I",feared I should never live to return.
The Tartar chieftains shoot so well that the,birds are afraid to fly: From the risk of their arrows I,escaped alive and fled swiftly home.
"Hiding all day and walking all night,",I crossed the Great Desert: Where clouds are dark and the moon,black and the sands eddy in the wind.
But the moving horsemen did not hear,that I spoke the Han tongue: Their Captain took me for,a Tartar born and had me bound in chains.
"They are sending me away to the south-east,",to a low and swampy land: No one now will take pity,on me: resistance is all in vain.
"Thinking of this, my voice chokes and I","ask of Heaven above, Was I spared from death only",to spend the rest of my years in sorrow?
My native village of Liang-yüan I,shall not see again: My wife and children in the Tartars’,land I have fruitlessly deserted.
"When I fell among Tartars and was taken prisoner,",I pined for the land of Han: Now that I am back in the land,"of Han, they have turned me into a Tartar."
Had I but known what,"my fate would be, I would not",have started home!
"For the two lands, so","wide apart, are alike in",the sorrow they bring.
Tartar,prisoners,in chains!
Of all the sorrows,of all the prisoners mine,is the hardest to bear!
Never in the world has so great a wrong,"befallen the lot of man,-- A Han heart and a Han",tongue set in the body of a Turk.
” A,Government-bull yoked to,a Government-cart!
Moored by the bank,"of Ch’an River, a barge",loaded with gravel.
A single load,"of gravel, How many",pounds it weighs!
Carrying at,"dawn, carrying at dusk, what",is it all for?
They are carrying,"it towards the Five Gates, To",the West of the Main Road.
Under the shadow,of green laurels they are,making a gravel-drive.
"For yesterday arrove, newly appointed, The","Assistant Chancellor of the Realm, And was terribly afraid",that the wet and mud Would dirty his horse’s hoofs.
The Chancellor’s horse’s hoofs Stepped on the,gravel and remained perfectly clean; But the bull employed,in dragging the cart Was almost sweating blood.
The Assistant Chancellor’s,"business Is to “save men, govern the country",And harmonize Yin and Yang.
” Whether the bull’s neck,is sore Need not trouble,him at all.
There was once a man who dreamt,he went to Heaven: His dream-body,soared aloft through space.
He rode on the back of,"a white-plumed crane, And was led on his flight",by two crimson banners.
Whirring of wings,and flapping of,coat tails!
Jade bells,suddenly,all a-tinkle!
"Half way to Heaven, he","looked down beneath him, Down on the dark",turmoil of the World.
Gradually he,lost the place of his native town; Mountains,and water--nothing else distinct.
The Eastern Ocean--a single,"strip of white: The Hills of China,--five",specks of green.
Gliding past him a host of fairies,swept In long procession to the Palace,of the Jade City.
They take him to the presence of,the Mighty Jade Emperor: He bows his,head and proffers loyal homage.
The Emperor says: “We see,you have fairy talents: Be of good,heart and do not slight yourself.
We shall send to fetch you in,fifteen years And give you a place in the,Courtyard of Immortality.
"” Twice bowing, he acknowledged","the gracious words: Then woke from sleep, full",of wonder and joy.
He hid his secret and dared,not tell it abroad: But vowed a vow,he would live in a cave of rock.
From love and affection he severed,kith and kin: From his eating and drinking he,omitted savoury and spice.
His morning meal was a,dish of coral-dust: At night he sipped an,essence of dewy mists.
In the empty mountains he,lived for thirty years Daily watching for,the Heavenly Coach to come.
The time of appointment,"was already long past, But",of wings and coach-bells--still no sound.
His teeth and hair daily withered,and decayed: His ears and eyes gradually,lost their keenness.
One morning he suffered the Common,Change And his body was one with the,dust and dirt of the hill.
Gods,and,fairies!
If indeed such things there,"be, Their ways are beyond the",striving of mortal men.
” Though you sweat and,"toil, what shall your",trouble bring?
You will only,shorten the five-score,years of your span.
"Sad, alas, the",man who dreamt of,Fairies!
For a single,dream spoiled his,whole life.
"Boundless,",the great,sea.
"Straight down,--no","bottom: sideways,--no",border.
Of cloudy waves and misty billows,"down in the uttermost depths Men have fabled,",in the midst there stand three sacred hills.
On the,"hills, thick growing,--herbs that banish",Death.
Wings grow on those who,eat them and they turn into,heavenly “hsien.
” The Lord of Ch’in and Wu of Han,believed in these stories: And magic-workers year by,year were sent to gather the herbs.
"The Blessed Islands,","now and of old, what",but an empty tale?
The misty waters,spread before them and they knew,not where to seek.
"Dauntless,",the mighty,wind.
Their eyes search but,cannot see the shores of,the Blessed Islands.
They cannot find the Blessed Isles and yet,they dare not return: Youths and maidens that began,the quest grew grey on board the boat.
Do you not see The graves,on the top of Black Horse Hill,and the tombs at Mo-ling?
What is left but the,sighing wind blowing in the,tangled grasses?
The Two Red Towers,North and south rise facing,each other.
I beg to,"ask, to whom do",they belong?
The two Princes blew on their flutes and,"drew down fairies from the sky, Who carried them off through the","Five Clouds, soaring away to Heaven."
"Their halls and houses, that they","could not take with them, Were turned into Temples",planted in the Dust of the World.
In the tiring-rooms and dancers’ towers all,is silent and still; Only the willows like dancers’,"arms, and the pond like a mirror."
When the flowers are falling at yellow,"twilight, when things are sad and hushed, One does not hear","songs and flutes, but only chimes and bells."
The Imperial Patent on the,Temple doors is written in letters of gold; For nuns’ quarters,and monks’ cells ample space is allowed.
For green moss and bright moonlight--plenty of room,provided; In a hovel opposite is a sick,man who has hardly room to lie down.
I remember once when at P’ing-yang they were,building a great man’s house How it swallowed up the housing,space of thousands of ordinary men.
"The Immortals are leaving us, two","by two, and their houses are turned into Temples; I begin to",fear that the whole world will become a vast convent.
An old charcoal-seller Cutting wood,and burning charcoal in the forests,of the Southern Mountain.
"His face, stained with dust","and ashes, has turned to",the colour of smoke.
The hair on his temples,is streaked with gray: his ten,fingers are black.
The money he gets,"by selling charcoal, how",far does it go?
It is just enough,to clothe his limbs and put food,in his mouth.
"Although, alas, the",coat on his back is a coat,without lining.
He hopes for the coming,"of cold weather, to send up",the price of coal!
"Last night, outside the city,--a whole",foot of snow; At dawn he drives the charcoal,wagon along the frozen ruts.
"Oxen,--weary; man,--hungry: the sun, already","high; Outside the Gate, to the south of the Market,",at last they stop in the mud.
"Suddenly,",a pair of prancing,horsemen.
Who,can it be,coming?
A public official,in a yellow coat and a,boy in a white shirt.
In their hands they hold a written warrant:,on their tongues--the words of an order; They turn back the wagon and curse,"the oxen, leading them off to the north."
A whole wagon,"of charcoal, More than",a thousand pieces!
If officials choose,"to take it away, the woodman",may not complain.
Half a piece of red silk and a single yard,"of damask, The Courtiers have tied to the oxen’s collar,",as the price of a wagon of coal!
I was going to the City to,sell the herbs I had plucked; On the way I rested,by some trees at the Blue Gate.
Along the road there came,a horseman riding; Whose face was pale,with a strange look of dread.
"Friends and relations, waiting","to say good-bye, Pressed at his side, but",he did not dare to pause.
"I, in wonder, asked the",people about me Who he was and,what had happened to him.
They told me this was a,Privy Councillor Whose grave duties were,like the pivot of State.
His food allowance was ten,thousand cash; Three times a day the,Emperor came to his house.
Yesterday he was called to,a meeting of Heroes: To-day he is banished,to the country of Yai-chou.
"So always, the Counsellors",of Kings; Favour and ruin changed,between dawn and dusk!
"Green, green,--the grass of the Eastern","Suburb; And amid the grass, a",road that leads to the hills.
Resting in peace among the,"white clouds, At last he has made",a “coup” that cannot fail!
At Hsin-fēng an old man--four-score and,eight; The hair on his head and the hair of,his eyebrows--white as the new snow.
"Leaning on the shoulders of his great-grandchildren,",he walks in front of the Inn; With his left arm he leans,on their shoulders; his right arm is broken.
I asked the old man how many years,had passed since he broke his arm; I also asked the cause of the,"injury, how and why it happened?"
The old man said he was born and reared,in the District of Hsin-fēng; At the time of his,birth--a wise reign; no wars or discords.
“Often I listened in the Pear-Tree Garden to,the sound of flute and song; Naught I knew of banner and,lance; nothing of arrow or bow.
Then came the wars of T’ien-pao,and the great levy of men; Of three men,"in each house,--one man was taken."
And those to,"whom the lot fell, where",were they taken to?
"When the great army waded across, the",water seethed like a cauldron; When barely ten had entered,"the water, two or three were dead."
"To the north of my village,",to the south of my village the sound of,weeping and wailing.
Children parting,from fathers and mothers; husbands,parting from wives.
Everyone says that in expeditions,against the Min tribes Of a million men who,"are sent out, not one returns."
"I, that am old, was then",twenty-four; My name and fore-name were written down,in the rolls of the Board of War.
In the depth of the night not daring,to let any one know I secretly took a huge,stone and dashed it against my arm.
Bones broken and sinews wounded,could not fail to hurt; I was ready enough to,"bear pain, if only I got back home."
My arm--broken ever,since; it was sixty,years ago.
"One limb, although","destroyed,--whole body",safe!
But even now on winter,nights when the wind and rain blow From evening on till day’s,dawn I cannot sleep for pain.
Not sleeping for pain Is a,"small thing to bear, Compared with the joy of being",alive when all the rest are dead.
"For otherwise, years ago, at the ford",of Lu River My body would have died and my soul,hovered by the bones that no one gathered.
Over the graves of,"ten thousand soldiers, mournfully",hovering.
” So,the old man,spoke.
And I bid you listen to his words Have you not,"heard That the Prime Minister of K’ai-yüan, Sung K’ai-fu, Did not reward frontier exploits,",lest a spirit of aggression should prevail?
And have you not heard That the Prime Minister,"of T’ien-Pao, Yang Kuo-chung Desiring to win imperial","favour, started a frontier war?"
But long before he could win the,"war, people had lost their temper; Ask the man with",the broken arm in the village of Hsin-fēng?
White billows and huge waves block the river,"crossing; Wherever I go, danger and difficulty;","whatever I do, failure."
Just as in my worldly career I,"wander and lose the road, So when I come to the river","crossing, I am stopped by contrary winds."
Of fishes and prawns sodden in the rain,the smell fills my nostrils; With the stings of insects that,"come with the fog, my whole body is sore."
I am growing,"old, time flies, and my short",span runs out.
While I sit in,"a boat at Chiu-k’ou,",wasting ten days!
I take your poems in my hand and,read them beside the candle; The poems are finished:,the candle is low: dawn not yet come.
With sore eyes by the guttering candle,"still I sit in the dark, Listening to waves that, driven","by the wind, strike the prow of the ship."
I have still to travel in my solitary,boat three or four leagues-- By misty waters and rainy,"sands, while the yellow dusk thickens."
"The forest trees are leafless and withered,--after",the mountain rain; The roofs of the houses are hidden,low among the river mists.
"The horses, fed on water grass, are",too weak to carry their load; The cottage walls of wattle,and thatch let the wind blow on one’s bed.
In the distance I see red-wheeled coaches,"driving from the town-gate; They have taken the trouble, these civil","people, to meet their new Prefect!"
There is no one among men that,has not a special failing: And my failing,consists in writing verses.
I have broken away from,the thousand ties of life: But this,infirmity still remains behind.
"And often, when I have finished","a new poem, Alone I climb the road",to the Eastern Rock.
I lean my body on the,banks of white stone: I pull down with my,hands a green cassia branch.
My mad singing startles,the valleys and hills: The apes and,birds all come to peep.
Fearing to become a,"laughing-stock to the world, I choose a place that is",unfrequented by men.
"At Nine Rivers, in the tenth year,","in winter,--heavy snow; The river-water covered with ice",and the forests broken with their load.
"The birds of the air, hungry and","cold, went flying east and west; And with them flew a migrant","“yen,” loudly clamouring for food."
Among the snow it pecked for grass; and rested,on the surface of the ice: It tried with its wings to scale,the sky; but its tired flight was slow.
The boys of the river spread a net,and caught the bird as it flew; They took it in their hands,to the city-market and sold it there alive.
I that was once a man of the,"North am now an exile here: Bird and man, in their","different kind, are each strangers in the south."
And because the sight of an exiled bird,"wounded an exile’s heart, I paid your ransom and set","you free, and you flew away to the clouds."
"Yen, Yen, flying","to the clouds, tell me, whither",shall you go?
The official army and the rebel army,have grown old in their opposite trenches; The soldier’s rations,"have grown so small, they’ll be glad of even you."
"The brave boys, in their hungry plight, will shoot",you and eat your flesh; They will pluck from your body those,long feathers and make them into arrow-wings!
"_You_, so bravely",splashing reds,and blues!
Just when _I_,am getting wrinkled,and old.
Why should you waste the moments,of inspiration Tracing the withered,limbs of a sick man?
"Tall, tall is the Palace",of Ch’i-lin; But my deeds have not been,frescoed on its walls.
Minutely limned on a,foot of painting silk-- What can I do,with a portrait such as _that_?
Yesterday I heard,that such-a-one was gone; This morning they,tell me that so-and-so is dead.
Of friends and acquaintances,more than two-thirds Have suffered change and,passed to the Land of Ghosts.
Those that are gone I shall not,"see again; They, alas, are for",ever finished and done.
Those that are,"left,--where are",they now?
"They are all scattered,--a",thousand miles,away.
Those I have known and loved,"through all my life, On the fingers of",my hand--how many do I count?
Longing for each other we are,all grown gray; Through the Fleeting World rolled,like a wave in the stream.
Alas that the feasts and,frolics of old days Have withered and,"vanished, bringing us to this!"
When shall we meet and,drink a cup of wine And laughing gaze,into each other’s eyes?
"Up and up,",the Incense-burner,Peak!
In my heart,is stored what my eyes,and ears perceived.
All the year--detained by,official business; To-day at last,I got a chance to go.
"Grasping the creepers, I",clung to dangerous rocks; My hands,and feet--weary with groping for hold.
There came with me,"three or four friends, But two friends dared",not go further.
At last we reached the topmost,"crest of the Peak; My eyes were blinded,",my soul rocked and reeled.
The chasm beneath,me--ten thousand feet; The ground I,"stood on, only a foot wide."
If you have not exhausted the scope,"of seeing and hearing, How can you realize",the wideness of the world?
The waters of the River,"looked narrow as a ribbon, P’ēn Castle",smaller than a man’s fist.
"How it clings,",the dust of the world’s,halter!
It chokes my,limbs: I cannot,shake it away.
"Thinking of retirement,","I heaved an envious sigh, Then, with lowered","head, came back to the Ants’ Nest."
My new Province is a,land of bamboo-groves: Their shoots in spring,fill the valleys and hills.
The mountain woodman cuts an,armful of them And brings them down to,sell at the early market.
Things are cheap in proportion,"as they are common; For two farthings,",I buy a whole bundle.
I put the shoots in a,great earthen pot And heat them up,along with boiling rice.
The purple nodules,"broken,--like an old brocade; The","white skin opened,--like new pearls."
Now every day,I eat them recklessly; For a,long time I have not touched meat.
Sent as a present,from Annam-- A red,cockatoo.
Coloured like the peach-tree,"blossom, Speaking with",the speech of men.
And they did to it,what is always done To the,learned and eloquent.
They took a,cage with stout bars And shut,it up inside.
After lunch--one short,nap: On waking up--two,cups of tea.
"Raising my head, I",see the sun’s light Once again,slanting to the south-west.
Those who are happy regret,the shortness of the day; Those who are sad,tire of the year’s sloth.
But those whose hearts are devoid,"of joy or sadness Just go on living,",regardless of “short” or “long.
"” Above, a mountain ten","thousand feet high: Below, a river",a thousand fathoms deep.
"A strip of green, walled by",cliffs of stone: Wide enough for the,passage of a single reed.
Long before night the,walls are black with dusk; Without,wind white waves rise.
The big rocks are like,a flat sword: The little rocks,resemble ivory tusks.
We are stuck,fast and cannot,move a step.
How much the,"less, three hundred",miles?
"Frail and slender, the twisted-bamboo","rope: Weak, the dangerous hold",of the towers’ feet.
A single slip--the whole,convoy lost: And _my_ life,hangs on _this_ thread!
I have heard a saying “He that has,an upright heart Shall walk scathless through,the lands of Man and Mo.
” How can I believe that,since the world began In every,shipwreck none have drowned but rogues?
"And how can I, born","in evil days And fresh from failure,",ask a kindness of Fate?
Often I fear that,these un-talented limbs Will be laid,at last in an un-named grave!
"Suddenly, suddenly,--bearing","a stricken heart I left the gates,",with nothing to comfort me.
"Henceforward,--relegated to deep seclusion In a bottomless","gorge, flanked by precipitous mountains, Five months on end the passage of boats",is stopped By the piled billows that toss and leap like colts.
The inhabitants of Pa,"resemble wild apes; Fierce and lusty,",they fill the mountains and prairies.
Among such as these I cannot hope,for friends And am pleased with anyone who,is even remotely human!
I took money and bought,flowering trees And planted them out on,the bank to the east of the Keep.
I simply bought whatever,"had most blooms, Not caring whether","peach, apricot, or plum."
"A hundred fruits, all mixed","up together; A thousand branches,",flowering in due rotation.
Each has its season coming,early or late; But to all alike the,fertile soil is kind.
The red flowers hang like,a heavy mist; The white flowers gleam,like a fall of snow.
The wandering bees cannot,bear to leave them; The sweet birds also,come there to roost.
In front there flows an ever-running,stream; Beneath there is built a little,flat terrace.
Sometimes I sweep the flagstones,"of the terrace; Sometimes, in the wind,",I raise my cup and drink.
The flower-branches screen my head,from the sun; The flower-buds fall,down into my lap.
"Alone drinking, alone singing",my songs I do not notice that the,moon is level with the steps.
The people of Pa do not,care for flowers; All the spring,no one has come to look.
"But their Governor General,",alone with his cup of wine Sits till evening,and will not move from the place!
"My niece, who is six","years old, is called “Miss Tortoise”; My","daughter of three,--little “Summer Dress."
” One is beginning to learn,to joke and talk; The other can already,recite poems and songs.
At morning they play clinging,about my feet; At night they sleep,pillowed against my dress.
"Why, children, did you reach","the world so late, Coming to me",just when my years are spent?
Young things draw our,feelings to them; Old people,easily give their hearts.
The sweetest vintage,at last turns sour; The full,moon in the end begins to wane.
And so with men the bonds of,love and affection Soon may change to a,load of sorrow and care.
But all the world is bound,by love’s ties; Why did I think that I,alone should escape?
Trees growing--right in front of,my window; The trees are high,and the leaves grow thick.
the distant mountain,"view Obscured by this, dimly",shows between.
One morning I took,knife and axe; With my own hand I,lopped the branches off.
Ten thousand leaves fall about,my head; A thousand hills came,before my eyes.
"Suddenly, as when clouds or mists break And straight through,","the blue sky appears; Again, like the face of a friend one has",loved Seen at last after an age of parting.
First there came a gentle,wind blowing; One by one the birds,flew back to the tree.
To ease my mind I gazed to,"the South East; As my eyes wandered,",my thoughts went far away.
Of men there is none that has,not some preference; Of things there is,none but mixes good with ill.
It was not that I did,not love the tender branches; But,"better still,--to see the green hills!"
I have been ill so long that,I do not count the days; At the southern,"window, evening--and again evening."
Sadly chirping in the,grasses under my eaves The winter,sparrows morning and evening sing.
By an effort I rise and lean,heavily on my bed; Tottering I,step towards the door of the courtyard.
By chance I meet a friend who,is coming to see me; Just as if,I had gone specially to meet him.
They took my couch and placed it in,the setting sun; They spread my rug and,I leaned on the balcony-pillar.
Tranquil talk was better than,any medicine; Gradually the,feelings came back to my numbed heart.
Little sleeping and much,"grieving,--the traveller Rises at midnight",and looks back towards home.
The sands are bright with moonlight,that joins the shores; The sail is white with,dew that has covered the boat.
"Nearing the sea, the river grows","broader and broader: Approaching autumn,--the",nights longer and longer.
Thirty times we have,"slept amid mists and waves, And",still we have not reached Hang-chow!
I grew up,at Jung-yang; I was still,young when I left.
"On and on,--forty years passed",Till again I stayed for,the night at Jung-yang.
"When I went away, I",was only eleven or twelve;,This year I am turned fifty-six.
Yet thinking back to the,"times of my childish games, Whole and undimmed,",still they rise before me.
The old houses have all,disappeared; Down in the village,none of my people are left.
It is not only that streets,and buildings have changed; But steep is level,and level changed to steep!
"Alone unchanged, the waters","of Ch’iu and Yu Passionless,--flow",in their old course.
"While on the road to his new province, Hang-chow, in 822,","he sends a silver spoon to his niece A-kuei, whom he had been obliged to leave","behind with her nurse, old Mrs."
Little girls ought to,be daintily,fed: Mrs.
"Ts’ao,",please see to,this!
That’s why I’ve packed and sent a,silver spoon; You will think of me and,eat up your food nicely!
Long ago to a white-haired,gentleman You made the present,of a black gauze hat.
The gauze hat still sits on,my head; But you already are gone,to the Nether Springs.
"The thing is old, but still",fit to wear; The man is gone and,will never be seen again.
Out on the hill the moon is,shining to-night And the trees on your tomb,are swayed by the autumn wind.
That so many of the,poor should suffer from cold what can,we do to prevent?
To bring warmth to,a single body,is not much use.
I wish I had a big rug,"ten thousand feet long, Which at one time could cover",up every inch of the City.
Our party scattered at yellow dusk,and I came home to bed; I woke at midnight and went for,"a walk, leaning heavily on a friend."
As I lay on my pillow my vinous,"complexion, soothed by sleep, grew sober; In front of the tower the ocean","moon, accompanying the tide, had risen."
"The swallows, about to return to the beams,","went back to roost again; The candle at my window, just","going out, suddenly revived its light."
"All the time till dawn came, still my thoughts",were muddled; And in my ears something sounded,like the music of flutes and strings.
"_Then_ on the shore,--building","sand-pagodas; _Now_, at Court, covered with",tinkling jade.
"This and that,--equally childish","games, Things whose substance passes in",a moment of time!
"While the hands are busy, the",heart cannot understand; When there are no,"Scriptures, then Doctrine is sound."
Even should one zealously,"strive to learn the Way, That very striving",will make one’s error more.
All the morning I have,lain perversely in bed; Now at,dusk I rise with many yawns.
My warm stove is quick to,get ablaze; At the cold mirror I,am slow in doing my hair.
With melted snow I,boil fragrant tea; Seasoned with,curds I cook a milk-pudding.
At my sloth and greed there,is no one but me to laugh; My cheerful vigour,none but myself knows.
The taste of my wine is mild and,works no poison; The notes of my harp,are soft and bring no sadness.
To the Three Joys in the book,of Mencius I have added the,fourth of playing with my baby-boy.
I break up cypress,and make a book-box; The box,"well-made,--and the cypress-wood tough."
In it shall be,kept what author’s,works?
The inscription,says PO,LO-T’IEN.
All my life has been spent,"in writing books, From when I was young",till now that I am old.
"First and last,--seventy","whole volumes; Big and little,--three",thousand themes.
All I can do is to divide them,among my daughters To be left by them,to give to my grandchildren.
"Between thirty and forty, one is","distracted by the Five Lusts; Between seventy and eighty,",one is a prey to a hundred diseases.
But from fifty to,sixty one is free from all ills;,Calm and still--the heart enjoys rest.
I have put behind me Love and Greed; I,have done with Profit and Fame; I am still short of illness,and decay and far from decrepit age.
Strength of limb I still possess to,seek the rivers and hills; Still my heart has spirit,enough to listen to flutes and strings.
At leisure I open new,wine and taste several cups; Drunken I recall,old poems and sing a whole volume.
"” Hundreds of houses,","thousands of houses,--like",a chess-board.
The twelve streets,like a field planted with,rows of cabbage.
"In the distance perceptible, dim,",dim--the fire of approaching dawn; And a single row,of stars lying to the west of the Five Gates.
Mounting on high I begin to realize,the smallness of Man’s Domain; Gazing into distance I begin,to know the vanity of the Carnal World.
I turn my head and hurry,"home--back to the Court and Market, A single",grain of rice falling--into the Great Barn.
Two top-knots not,yet plaited into,one.
Of thirty,years--just beyond,half.
You who are really a lady,of silks and satins Are now become my,hill and stream companion!
At the spring fountains together,we splash and play: On the lovely trees,together we climb and sport.
"Her cheeks grow rosy, as","she quickens her sleeve-dancing: Her brows grow sad,",as she slows her song’s tune.
Don’t go singing the Song of,"the Willow Branches, When there’s no one",here with a heart for you to break!
At night you came and took my hand and we wandered,together in my dream; When I woke in the morning there was no one to,stop the tears that fell on my handkerchief.
On the banks of the Ch’ang my aged body,three times has passed through sickness; At Hsien-yang to the grasses,on your grave eight times has autumn come.
You lie buried beneath,the springs and your bones are,mingled with the clay.
I--lodging in the,world of men; my hair,white as snow.
A-wei and Han-lang both followed in,their turn; Among the shadows of the Terrace,of Night did you know them or not?
"At night, in my","dream, I stoutly climbed",a mountain.
Going out alone,with my staff of,holly-wood.
"A thousand crags, a hundred hundred valleys-- In",my dream-journey none were unexplored And all the while my feet never grew tired,And my step was as strong as in my young days.
Can it be that when the,mind travels backward The body also,returns to its old state?
"And can it be, as between","body and soul, That the body may","languish, while the soul is still strong?"
Soul and body--both are,vanities: Dreaming and waking--both,alike unreal.
In the day my feet are palsied,and tottering; In the night my steps,go striding over the hills.
As day and night are,divided in equal parts-- Between the,"two, I _get_ as much as I _lose_."
Congratulating himself on,the comforts of his life after his,retirement from office.
"Lined coat, warm cap and easy felt slippers,","In the little tower, at the low window, sitting",over the sunken brazier.
"Body at rest,",heart at peace; no need to,rise early.
I wonder if the courtiers,at the Western Capital know,"of these things, or not?"
No new poems his,brush will trace: Even,his fame is dead.
His old poems are deep,in dust At the bottom of,boxes and cupboards.
"Once lately, when someone was singing,",Suddenly I heard a verse-- Before I had time,to catch the words A pain had stabbed my heart.
“Those who speak know,nothing; Those who know,are silent.
"” These words, as","I am told, Were spoken",by Lao-tzŭ.
If we are to believe that Lao-tzŭ,"Was himself _one who knew_, How comes it that he wrote",a book Of five thousand words?
Chuang-tzŭ levels all things,And reduces them to,the same Monad.
But _I_ say that,even in their sameness,Difference may be found.
A traveller,came from across the seas Telling,of strange sights.
“In a deep fold of the,sea-hills I saw a terrace,and tower.
In the midst there,stood a Fairy Temple With,one niche empty.
They all told me,this was waiting,For Lo-t’ien to come.
"” Traveller, I have studied the Empty Gate;",I am no disciple of Fairies The story you,have just told Is nothing but an idle tale.
The hills of,ocean shall never,be Lo-t’ien’s home.
When I leave the earth,it will be to go To the Heaven,of Bliss Fulfilled.
They have put my bed beside the,unpainted screen; They have shifted my stove,in front of the blue curtain.
"I listen to my grandchildren,","reading me a book; I watch the servants,",heating up my soup.
With rapid pencil I answer,the poems of friends; I feel in my pockets,and pull out medicine-money.
When this superintendence of,"trifling affairs is done, I lie back on my",pillows and sleep with my face to the South.

Who will then tell me in whispers,and where must I find just the window Where one day she'll,be glimpsed: creature who'll scorch me with love?
Can't I divine yet the paths through,which over and over To her and from her,"I'll go, squandering valuable time?"

"With my business accomplished, ah,","then shall only one temple, AMOR's temple","alone, take the initiate in."

More than ever I,"dreamed, I have found it: my",happy good fortune!
Cupid,sagaciously led,past those palazzos so fine.
He of course knows very well (and I,"have also discovered) What, beneath tapestries","rich, gilded boudoirs conceal."
One may if one wishes,"call him a blind, wanton boy--but I know you,","Clever Cupid, too well!"
"O,",incorruptible,god!
"Here he provides me with ev'rything,",sees that I get what I call for; Each day that passes,he spreads freshly plucked roses for me.
--Isn't that,heaven,on earth?
"Say, beautiful","Lady Borghese, What would you",give to me more?
Banquets and game,"tables, operas, balls, promenades",down the Corso?
These but deprive,my sweet boy of his,most opportune times.
"Finery,",haughtiness do,not entice me.
Does one not lift a,Gown of the finest brocade just as,one lifts common wool?
If she's to press in comfort a,"lover against that soft bosom, Doesn't he want",her to be free from all brooches and chains?
"Must not the jewelry, and then the",lace and the bustles and whalebone All of it come,"off entire, if he's to learn how she feels?"
I encounter,no troubles,like those.
"Simple dress of rough homespun,","At but a lover's mere touch, tumbles",in folds to the floor.
Quickly he carries the girl as,she's clad in chemise of coarse linen-- Just as a nursemaid,"might, playfully up to her bed."
Drapings of satin,are absent; the mattress is,quite unembroidered.
Large is this room where,the bed offers its,comfort for two.
Jupiter's welcome to more from his,Juno if he can get it; Let any mortal find,"rest, softer, wherever he can."
"We are content with Cupid's delights,",authentic and naked-- And with the exquisite,creak /crack of the bed as it rocks.
Ask whomever you will but you'll,"never find out where I'm lodging, High society's","lords, ladies so groomed and refined."
"""Tell me,",was Werther,authentic?
Did all of,that happen in,real life?
""" ""Lotte, oh where did she","live, Werther's only",true love?
""" How many times have I cursed those",frivolous pages that broadcast Out among all,mankind passions I felt in my youth!
"Were he my brother,",why then I 'd have murdered,poor Werther.
Yet his despondent,ghost couldn't have sought,worse revenge.
"Do not, beloved, regret that",you yielded to me so quickly: I entertain,"no base, insolent thoughts about you."
Arrows,of Cupid work divers,effects.
Some do but scratch us:,Slow and insidious these,poison our hearts over years.
Yet with a head freshly honed and,"cunningly fledged, certain others Pierce to the marrow,",inflame rapidly there our blood.
When gods and goddesses in days of,"heroes made love, then Lust followed look and desire,","with no delay, was indulged."
Surely you don't think the goddess of,"love lost a moment reflecting When, in","Idean grove, Anchises caught her eye."
Nor did Luna delay about kissing,that beautiful dreamer-- Jealous Aurora had,else hastily wakened the lad.
At the loud banquet Hero regarded,"Leander--then promptly Into dark waters he plunged,",ardently swam toward his love.
Today a proud Rome,claims to be queen,of the world.
We are,"so pious,",we lovers.
Discreetly we worship,"all powers, Hoping for favor from each",god and each goddess as well.
Therefore we gladly confess to singling,a special immortal And our devotions each,day pledging but solely to her.
Mischievous celebrants we at these,"mysteries gay, and so solemn: Silence exactly",befits rites at which we're adepts.
Sweet,"Opportunity,",that is her name.
You,should,meet her.
Often will she,"turn up, ever",in a new form.
Daughter of Proteus,might well she be whom he sired,upon Thetis.
In metamorphoses,they've many a hero,deceived.
So now the daughter beguiles the naive,"and bedazzles the foolish, Teases you while you're","asleep; when you awaken, she's flown."
Eagerly yields herself,"up to the quick, to the active",man only.
He discovers,"she's tame, playful and",tender and sweet.
"Once she appeared to me, too:","a dark-skinned girl, tumbling Over her forehead",the hair down in waves heavy and dark.
Round about a delicate neck,curled short little ringlets; Up from the crown of,her head crinkled the unbraided hair.
When she dashed,"by me I seized her,",mistaking her not.
Lovingly Kiss and,"embrace she returned, knowing",and teaching me how.
O how,enraptured,I was!
"Ah, say",now no,more.
It's,a,bygone.
"But, O pigtails","of Rome, still I'm",entrammled in you.
Happily now on,classical soil I feel,inspiration.
Voices from present,and past speak here,evocatively.
"Heeding ancient advice,",I leaf through the works of the Ancients,With an assiduous hand.
Daily,the pleasure's,renewed.
"Throughout the night, in a different","way, I'm kept busy by Cupid-- If erudition","is halved, rapture is doubled that way."
Do then I not become wise when,"I trace with my eye her sweet bosom's Form, and",the line of her hips stroke with my hand?
"I acquire, As I reflect and compare,","my first understanding of marble, See with an eye","that feels, feel with a hand that sees."
"While my beloved, I grant it,","deprives me of moments of daylight, She in",the nighttime hours gives compensation in full.
And we do more than just kiss; we,prosecute reasoned discussions (Should she succumb to,"sleep, that gives me time for my thoughts)."
In her embrace--it's by no means unusual--I've composed poems,"And the hexameter's beat gently tapped out on her back, Fingertips counting",in time with the sweet rhythmic breath of her slumber.
Air from deep in,her breast penetrates,mine and there burns.
"Cupid, while stirring the flame in our","lamp, no doubt thinks of those days when For the triumvirs",he similar service performed.
"""Can you be cruel",enough to sadden me thus with,reproaches?
"Germans speak,","I suppose, bitterly",when they're in love.
Bear it I must when the,gossips bring forth accusations:,I'm guilty-- Or am I not?
"But, alas, all",of my guilt was,with you.
Clothes that you've given bear witness for,envious neighbors That the poor widow no,more grieves for her husband alone.
Did you not thoughtlessly visit,"me in the disguise of a cleric, Muffled all up in","a cloak, hair all rounded behind?"
Who was,it chose that gray monk if,not you?
Well then a prelate,"Now is my lover--Ah, who is",my prelate but you?
"Never, incredible as it","may sound in this clerical city, Has any cleric",brought me--swear it I will--to his bed.
I was,sufficiently,"poor, sad to say."
The,seducers Noted,it well.
Falconier,ogled me often,enough.
One of the pimps for Albani,with billets doux very impressive,Called me to Ostia once.
Quattro,Fontani,next time.
Who was,it did not appear,there?
"Why, who but the very",same girl who Hated with all of her heart,stockings both violet and red.
For: 'In the end you,poor girls are the ones who are,sure to be cheated.
' So said my,father although--Mother was,not much impressed.
Father,was,right.
Here I stand in,the end being cheated,and scolded.
You don't believe,your own,words.
They're your,excuse to,escape.
Unworthy,of women are,men.
"We, who carry your children","Next to our hearts, in these hearts loyalty","we bear you, too."
"As for you men, when you've poured out your",potency in our embraces And your desires,"dissipate, love with them passes away."
""" These things expressed, and taking her child","from its chair, my beloved Presses it close to","her heart, kisses it, tears in her eyes."
I'm now so very ashamed of,myself for having permitted Gossip of neighbors,to spoil picture so eloquent.
For a short moment,a fire may burn darkly,while smoke swirls about it.
Water dashed on,the coals suddenly smothers,their glow.
Rapidly then renewed heat overcomes,"those lowering vapors, Sends up a flame that anew",bright and more powerful gleams.
How very happy I am here,in Rome when I think of the bad days Far back,"there in the north, wrapped in a grayish light."
Over my head there the heavens weighed,"down so dismal and gloomy; Colorless, formless,",that world round this exhausted man lay.
"Seeking myself in myself, an","unsatisfied spirit, I brooded, Spying out pathways","dark, lost in dreary reflection."
Phoebus the god,"evokes forms, clear are",his colors by day.
"Bright with the stars comes the evening,","ringing with songs that are tender, And the glow","of the moon, brighter than northern sun."
What,blessedness mortals,may know!
Am,I now,dreaming?
Or welcomes,"Jupiter, Father, as guest--me,",to ambrosial halls?
"See, I lie here",extending my arms,toward your knees.
I am praying:,"Hospitality's god,",Jupiter Xenius!
Hear: How I am come,to this place I no longer,can say--I was Seized up by Hebe.
'Twas she,led to this sacred,hill.
Did you command her,a hero to seek and,deliver before you?
May be,she,erred.
Let her,mistake profit,me!
"Does not Fortuna, your daughter,","when strewing her glorious presents, After the manner","of girls, yield to each passing whim?"
"You, O hospitable god, will by",no means now banish a stranger From your Olympian,heights back to the base earth again.
"""--Forgive me, Jupiter, is not",Rome's Capitoline Hill second,Olympus to you?
"Suffer me, Jupiter, here and",let Hermes guide me at last then Past Cestius',Tomb gently to Orkus below.
"When you were small, you say, neither did others consider","you f air, nor Even your mother find praise--and I believe it-- Till you grew","bigger, developing quietly over the years."
I Picture you,to myself as an,unusual child.
Also the blossoms on grapevines are wanting,"in shape and in color, Although the fruit when it's",ripe pleases both mankind and gods.
Kindling autumnal fire in a,"rustic, convivial fireplace (How the sticks crackle",and spew flames and glittering sparks!
) Strikes me,especially pleasant,this evening.
"Then in the morning, officious,","she'll leave the bed of her lover, Rouse adroitly",the flames out from their ashes anew.
Cupid has lent to her above,others the gift of cajoling Up from the ashes,"desire, just when slumber's begun."
"Therefore, ye living, rejoice that","love keeps you warm for a while yet, Until cold","Lethe anoints, captures your foot in its flight."
"They are for you, O ye graces, just a","few leaves by a poet Onto your pure altar laid, buds","of the rose beside, Offered in confidence."
"But it's to Bacchus, the sensuous","dreamer, Cythera sends glances Bathed in sweetest",desire--even in marble they're damp.
Thinking about his embrace and its,"pleasures, she seems to be asking Shouldn't our",glorious son here at our side stand erect?
"Can't you hear voices,","beloved, out on the Via",Flamina?
Reapers are now,"going home, back from",harvesting grain.
"They had journeyed to Rome from afar,",and here plaited for Ceres Wreaths which the Romans,today scorn to make for themselves.
Festivals no longer celebrate,"Ceres, the nourishing goddess Who replaced acorns","of old, giving man golden wheat."
Let us commemorate her,then ourselves in festival private (Two constitute,"a whole tribe, when they are two in love)."
Have you by any chance heard how that,"mystical, strange celebration Followed victorious",troops back from Eleusis to Rome?
"Greeks were the ones who began it, and",only to Greeks they proclaimed it Even within Roman,"walls: ""Come to the sanctified night."
""" Those who were not of the cult kept","their distance; neophytes trembled, Waiting in garments of","white, symbol of all that is pure."
Then the initiates must aimlessly,wander about through the eerie Circles of figures as,if pilgriming through their own dreams.
Snakes on the,ground were writhing,about.
Surely the gestures of murmuring,priests must contain some deep meaning-- Impatient,"acolytes wait, anxiously hoping for light."
Not until after many a testing,"and trial did they discover What, within sacred","ring, secretive image concealed."
What was this mystery other,"than this:   that Demeter, goddess, Once upon a",time had to a hero been kind.
"It was to Jason, powerful king","of the Cretans, she granted Of her immortal",self hidden sweet parts to explore.
That made,the fortune,of Crete!
The marital bed of the,"goddess Soon grew pregnant with grain, heavy",her bounteous fields.
"As for the rest of the world, it","languished away, while Ceres, Derelict of her true","task, dalliance offered in love."
"--Now the initiate youths, having","followed this tale, all astonished, Turned and beckoned","their loves--love, do you comprehend?"
See there the sacred,shade beneath that bushy-boughed,myrtle?
Our satisfaction,will there scarcely endanger,a world.
Cupid is always,"a scoundrel, and if you believe",him he'll cheat you.
Here's what the hypocrite,"said: ""Trust me just once","more, this time."
I have the best of intentions toward,you who have now dedicated-- I recognize,it with thanks--life and writings to me.
"Lo, I have followed you hither to","Rome, and I'd like to do something Here in this far away",land pleasing to such an old friend.
Every traveller I've ever,known has complained of poor treatment: He whom I,recommend treatment delicious receives.
How you've revered,the formative will of,those ancient artists!
In their own,ateliers often I,'ve visited them.
"As for their works, why,",I formed those myself--now this time,I'm boasting Not.
"Oh come now, admit",what I am saying,is true.
Where are your own,"creations, your service to",me having slackened?
Where is,invention's,glow now?
Where is,the color,all gone?
"Friend, do you",hope you can create,again?
--The school of the Ancients,Yet remains,open.
"Its gates,",years have not closed,them to you.
I am eternally,"young, and as teacher I still",love the young ones.
Wisdom that comes,with old age pleases,me not.
Listen here: Wasn't,antiquity young when those fortunate,Ancients were living?
Happy then be,"your life, too: in it",antiquity lives.
Where will,you find a fit theme for,your song?
--It is,I must,provide it.
As for a style,"truly grand, love can",alone give you that.
""" All of these claims",that sophist,asserted.
Could I,contradict,him?
I am wont to,"obey, when my",commander decrees.
Treacherous now he is keeping his word:,giving me themes for my poems While he is stealing,"my time, potency, presence of mind."
"Gazing into her eyes, holding hands, giving kisses,","exchanging Syllables sweet and those words lovers alone understand, Murmuring our",conversations we stutter in sweet oratory.
Hymns of such sort pass,"away, wanting",prosodical tact.
"Goddess of morning,","Aurora, as friend of my",muse I once knew you.
Has the unprincipled,"god, Cupid, seduced",you now too?
So that these mornings you come as his,"sweetheart, awakening me at His festive altar","again, where I must celebrate him?"
"Here on my breast flows her hair, an","abundance of curls, while her head rests, Pressing my","arm as it's bent, so as to pillow her neck."
"Love in our hearts makes us one,",as the genuine need there stays constant; Only,returning desire knows oscillation or change.
Gently her hand presses,"mine, now she opens her eyes and is",looking Into my own eyes.
Let my,thoughts rest,on your form!
Please,close your,eyes.
"They're inebriation,","confusion, they rob me All too soon of",the joy quiet reflection affords.
Grand are the forms of,this body and nobly,positioned each member.
Had Ariadne,"lain thus, Theseus",never had fled.
Only a single kiss for,"these lips and then, O Theseus, leave",her; Look at her eyes--she's awake!
Now you're,eternally,bound.
"Boy, won't",you light me,a lamp.
"""But dear master,",there's light in the sky,yet.
Don't waste,your oil and,the wick.
Don't close,the shutters,so soon.
Only the houses,"are blocking the sun there, it's",not yet the mountains.
Until the curfew,"shall ring, full half an",hour must pass.
""" Wretched young","fellow, be gone and",obey me!
My loved,one is,coming.
"Lamplight, console","me till then, harbinger",warm of the night.
Poets of old in chorus cried out against those,"two serpents, Making them horrible names, hated in all of the world: Python","the one, the other the Hydra of Lerna."
These monsters Both,"have now been destroyed, thanks to the",deeds of the gods.
"Fire-breathing, venomous once, they",no longer now depredate our Flocks,"and meadows and woods, fields of golden grain."
How is it then that some spiteful,god in his wrath has Raised from the poisonous slime offspring,so monstrous again?
There's an insidious viper creeps,"into the loveliest gardens, Lying in wait",to attack all who seek pleasure therein.
Noble Hesperian,"dragon, I call you courageous",and forthright.
Boldly defending,your own beautiful apples,of gold.
"As for this worm, why he is not guarding","at all, for his presence Sullies both garden and","fruit, till they deserve no defense."
Happy Lucretius knew how in,"his day to forego love completely, Fearing not",to enjoy pleasure in anyone's arms.
"Fortunate Ancient, Propertius,",for you a slave fetched the girls down From the,"Aventine Hill, from Tarpeia's grove."
"Cynthia then, when driving you out","of such unchaste embraces, Found you unfaithful,","it's true, but she did find you whole."
Who would today dare attempt,to escape from fidelity's,ennui?
Love does not,hold one back--only concern,for one's health.
Even the woman we love may afford,us uncertain enjoyment; Nowhere can feminine,lap safely encouch a man's head.
Matrimonial bed's insecure,"and so's fornication; Husband, lover and",wife pass to each other the hurt.
Think of those ages of gold when,"Jupiter followed his urges, Chose Callisto","one day, turned to Semel the next."
It was important to him to find,"thresholds of temples so sacred Pure when, enamoured,",he sought powerful entry to them.
Can you imagine the ragings of,Juno if in love's skirmish Poisonous weapons on,her by her own spouse had been turned?
But we neo-pagans may not after all be,abandoned entirely: Yet there is speeding a god mercifully,"over the earth, Quick and assiduous."
Everyone knows him and ought,"to adore him, Herald of Zeus:","Hermes, the healing god."
"Cupid will hold out his hand: O, and entrusting","myself to the rascal, I beg you please may I Do so in pleasure",with no danger or worry or fear.
I cannot think I'd have gone with,Julius Caesar to Britain; To the Popina,"right here, Florus would tug me with ease."
Fogs of the dreary north remain,a more baleful remembrance Than in the kitchens,of Rome tribes of assiduous fleas.
"After today, I'll remember you even","more kindly, tavernas, You osterias, as you","are called, aptly by those here in Rome."
That was the place I encountered my,mistress today with the uncle Whom she so often,"deceives, so that she can have me."
She is of course well aware That,"I am watching, so finally makes the V of the","Roman Five, with a virgule before."
"Quickly, as soon as I've seen, She interlaces","the circles, reducing them all to ornatest Patterns--but still the",sweet IV stood as engraved in my eye.
I sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost,"bloody Half from delight at the ruse, partly from stifled desire: Such a","long time until dark, then another four hours of waiting."
"--Sun, who tarries on high, contemplating Rome: Greater","never you've nor shall you in future see greater Than Rome, O","sun, as your priest, Horace, enraptured foretold."
Tarry,no longer,today.
Go seek other,realms beneath,heaven.
Sooner depart,and leave Rome's seven,famed hills to me.
Please do the poet a favor,and shorten the glorious hours Which the painter,"devours, eagerly filling his eyes."
Then Hastily,plunge to the,ocean.
"First were but few simple dwellings here,",suddenly sunlight discovered Nations enlivening,hills teeming with fortunate thieves.
Onto this spot they assembled such,"plunder, in your eye so splendid All earth's remaining",orb scarcely was worthy of note.
"You watched a world being born here, watched","the same world sink to ruin, And from those ruins","yet arise world again greater, perhaps."
O may I,long by your light,now behold this Rome.
O but come rushing,the moment my love designated,so sweetly.
"--No, but",I heard at least,three.
"Thus, my dear muses,",again you've beguiled the,monotony for me.
Of this long interval,while I was apart,from my love.
All,"of you now,",farewell!
I'll be going,now--don't be,offended.
"For, though you're proud, you'll",concede: Cupid in,my heart comes first.
Why did you fail to,appear at the cot in the,"vineyard today, Love?"
As I had promised,"I would, long I awaited",you there.
"""Dear, I had almost arrived when I","saw, by good fortune, your uncle Standing right there by","the vines, looking now this way, now that."
Stealthily,I slipped,away.
You saw,"the scarecrow,",that's all.
Nothing,else drove you,away.
Reeds and some discarded garments all,hastily cobbled together-- I helped to make,it myself: diligent in my own grief.
"""Well, now",his wish,is fulfilled.
The old gardner's most dissolute,crow has Left on this day unscathed nice little,garden and niece.
""" While there is many an","unpleasant sound, I hate to hear barking",Worse than anything else.
Bellowing,dogs split my,ears.
"Nevertheless I do like to hear,",and take pleasure in listening To the loud,howl of the dog raised from a pup next door.
That is the dog that so bayed one time,at my girl that he almost Gave our secret,away (when she was visiting me).
"Now, when I hear the dog barking I think",my beloved is coming-- Or I remember,"the time, when long awaited she came."
I can tell not only about a discomfort,"far greater than others, But of a horror besides, thinking of which",will arouse Every fiber in me to revulsion.
"My friends, I confess it:",Great displeasure I take lying,alone in my bed.
That's why Faustina as my companion,in bed makes me happy: Loving she always remains,"faithful, as I am to her."
Young men are aroused in their passions by,obstacles and by excitement; I prefer to,"go slow, savoring pleasures secure."
Is it not bliss to exchange tender,"kisses containing no dangers, Sucking into our","lungs, carefree, our partner's own life?"
That is the way our,long nights of enjoyment,are passed.
"We listen, Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain","in the wind Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching",Blossoms that will adorn festive the coming new day.
"Quirites, permit me the joy, and may","this, of all pleasures on earth the First and the last,",be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god.
"Ah, to uphold",one's respectable,name is not easy.
The Lady Fame,"has an ancient foe: Cupid,",my master and lord.
"Oh, by the way, have",you heard of the cause of their,mutual hatred?
"It's an old story,",I think--Let me just tell it,again.
"Powerful ever the goddess, but",nevertheless to her fellows Overbearing,"and rude, quite unendurable."
She Had by the gods since time out of,"mind at their banquets been dreaded, Yelling with brassiest",voice orders to great and to small.
"Once, in her arrogance even maintained","that she had subjected To her own will, as her","slave, Jove's most illustrious son."
"""One of these days, O father of","deities,"" cried she in triumph, ""I shall be","bringing you my--Hercules, as if new born."
Don't think that Hercules be still that,boy whom Alcmene once bore you; His adulation,of me makes him now god upon earth.
When toward Olympus,"he gazes, I've no doubt you hope that he's",looking Piously toward your knees.
He's,looking,for me.
O the vision of winning my,"favor makes easy Hitherto unexplored paths,",under that powerful foot.
"I do my part, for I meet him halfway",and proclaim his adventures Praising his name in,"advance, even before he's begun."
One day,you'll wed me to,Hercules.
Hero who,Amazons conquered That,day will overwhelm me.
Happily,I'll call him:, spouse.
""" All of the gods kept their counsel, and","none would reply to the braggart, Lest in a pique she",devise vengeance against one of them.
"Scene now completed and ready to tease,","he goes scampering, shouting For all Olympus","to hear: ""Come, see these glorious deeds!"
Heaven and Earth and the Sun on his,indefatigable journey Over that,infinite path never did witness the like!
""" Everyone hastened, gulled by the","dissolute boy, who feigning Earnest, had summoned",them all (Fame by no means lagged behind).
Which of the gods will,now smile in sweet condescension,on Cupid?
"delighted, of course,",seeing a man,humbled so.
"Fame, on the other","hand, stood there ashamed, embarrassed,",despairing.
First she just,"laughed, saying: ""Gods, be",not deceived.
It's,a,masque.
I know my hero,too well to be fooled by,disguises of actors.
""" Soon, though, in","pain she perceived: Hercules,",none but he.
"How those boys, Bacchus and Mercury, guffawed, and","freely admitted: Sweet must be the repose, lying on bosom",so fine Of this magnificent woman.
They turned to Vulcan,"entreating: ""Do not release",them just yet.
Let us,inspect them,once more.
""" And the old cuckold",was cuckold enough to comply,with their wishes.
") As for poor Fame,","in all haste, burning",with wrath she must flee.
Since then no armistice,has been proclaimed to the feuding,between them.
Let her but favor,"a man, hot in pursuit",is the boy.
He whom Fame honors most can least,"defend against Cupid, And her most dang'rous attacks",strike the most morally proud.
Whoever tries to,escape him is dragged down from,bad deeds to worse ones.
"Yes, he will offer you girls--if like a fool you despise","These, only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious: Heat","of man's love for man, ardent desires toward beasts."
For those ashamed of him Cupid,"reserves the bitterest passions, Mingling for hypocrites",their pleasure in vice and remorse.
"But, at the same time,","the goddess seeks him, she's",watching and list'ning.
"Should find him with you, ill disposed will she be: Frighten","you, frowning austerely, contemptuously, violently casting Into",the worst of repute houses he's known to frequent.
"Ah, it's the",same with,"me, too."
I haven't,"escaped her, the",goddess.
Jealously she,"seeks me out, sweet secret",love to expose.
I will submit to the ancient,"law and in silence revere her, For, when great lords","fall out, I like the Greeks must atone."
"However comely be strength, or","free and undaunted comportment, Secrecy is for",a man most important of all.
"Mighty subduer of cities,","Discretion, O princess of nations, Goddess whom","I adore, safely you've led me thus far."
"Now, though, what",fate shall befall,me?
My frivolous muse has,"now opened --Cupid, the scamp--opens lips",hitherto sealed so well.
"Difficult is it, alas, to conceal the","shame of a monarch; Hide it can neither his crown, nor a",tight Phrygian cap: Midas has asses ears!
the first,servant discovers--O,horror!
Shame of this secret,"so weighs, Midas",unburdens his heart.
Into the earth for safekeeping the,"servant must bury the story, Easing in this",way the king:  earth must conceal the tale.
Reeds in a trice are sprouting and,"rustling in murmuring breezes: ""Midas, o Midas",the King--bears the ears of an ass!
""" Mine is a secret more pleasant, but",even more difficult keeping: Out of abundance,of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.
None of my ladyfriends dare I confide,"in, for they would but chide me; Nor any gentleman","friend, lest he be rival to me."
Rapture proclaim to,"the grove, to the echoing",cliffs perorate it?
One can do that if,"one's young, or if one's",lonely enough.
"I to hexameters tell, in",pentameters I will confide it: During the,"day she was joy, happiness all the night long."
"She's coming, and must",not be seen by,the neighbor!
"Breezes, rustle",the leaves: muffle the,sound of her feet.
"And as for you, little poems, o","grow and flower, your blossoms Cradling themselves in","the air, tepid and soft with love's breath."
"Wafting, betray to Quirites, as","Midas' reeds did with cheap gossip, One happy couple in","love, and their sweet secret, at last."
"I in the back of the garden,","the last of the gods, in a corner,","Ineptly formed, must I stand."
Evil,the inroads,of time.
Cucumber vines grow entwining,"about this primeval lingam, Cracking it almost",in two under the weight of the fruit.
Faggots are heaped all about me against the,"cold of the winter, Which I so hate for the crows settling then","down on my head, Which they befoul very shamefully."
Summer's no better: the servants,"Empty their bowels and show insolent,",naked behinds.
"Filth,",above and,below!
I was clearly in danger,"of turning Into filth myself, toadstool,",rotten wood!
"Now, by your efforts, O","noblest of artists, I shall recover With",fellow gods my just place.
And it's,no more than,my due.
"Jupiter's throne, so dishonestly","won, it was I who secured it: Color and ivory,","marble and bronze, not to mention the poems."
"Now, all intelligent",men look upon me,in kindness.
They like to Form their,"own image of me, just as",the poet has done.
Nor do the girls take,offense when they see me--by no,means the matrons.
None finds me ugly,"today, though I am",monstrously strong.
